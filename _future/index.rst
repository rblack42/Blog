Updating the Blog Theme
#######################

Although I have been using Pelican to set up the theme for my blog, I have not
been totally satisfied with it. So, I decided to explore other options. I ran
into this project:

    * https://bitbucket.org/scons/scons-pelican-bootstrap3

WHich took me down a few paths tpward better styling for the site.

I purchased a commercial style from `WrapBootstrap.com
<https://wrapbootstrap.com>`_ which should make things even better.
