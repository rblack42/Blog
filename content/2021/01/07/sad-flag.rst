My US Flag was sad this morning. I found it lying in the bushes where it fell
when it jumped off of my outside wall mount.

I have a T-Shirt that says: "You can't fix stupid, not even with duct tape!"

I had to reassure my flag that all is not lost and I reattached it to the wall
mount.

I used duct tape to make sure it stays flying.

Maybe you cannot fix stupid - but you can fix your flag!
