Just when I was thinking the human race was getting too stupid to invent
anything interesting - this contraption showed up this morning:

It arrived sitting on a flat-bed truck all folded up. It spread out its legs,
lowered them to the ground then lifted itself so the truck could drive away.
Then it lowered itself to the ground, folded up, and ran on the rubber tank
treads into my back driveway so it could work on a neighbor's tree. The trimmer
guy hooked himself up in the basket and lifted 60 feet into the air to do his
work. They made quite a mess in my driveway, but they are cleaning it all up
now.

Fascinating! I want them to leave it behind, so I can hook up a few
microcomputers and teach it how to walk all by itself. Should not be too hard
to do! It would have made a great lab project for my students back when I had
those around. Hmmm...
