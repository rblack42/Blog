On Not Learning New Things

In my last post, I talked about my life long passion for learning new things.
What happens if you decide not to live that kind of life? 

..  note::

    All of this is pure conjecture on my part. I do not really know how to live
    this kind of non-learning life, and I intend to keep it that way.

Meetings
********

In your working life, you will get to sit through meetings with your
co-workers. There is an old joke about this:

    We need to have a meeting to discuss why we have all these
    meetings!
    
In these meetings, you will encounter a variety of approaches to life,
and a variety of "passion levels" towards the work you and your
co-workers do.  You need to experience this. (That is why I encourage
working in teams in my classes!)

You might think the younger folks would be eager to learn how to make
contributions in their new jobs. You might think the older folks are
looking forward to getting out of their jobs, and retiring. Truth is, you will
run into folks with exactly these feelings regardless of their age. You have to
learn how to be the kind of person you want to be, in the face of working with
others who feel very differently!

In my career, I have been in meetings where it was obvious that some in the
room had no interest in examining how we were doing our work. Sadly, those
folks seemed to be blissfully unaware that some of their co-workers were
struggling to get their jobs done. They also seemed not to know that, in part,
their behaviours contributed to that struggle. Those meetings were never
pleasant!

To me, that said that those folks were probably more interested in doing the
one job they knew well. They did not feel that worrying about how, or even if,
their job was moving our clients (customers?) or co-workers forward. That issue
was not their concern. All they seemed to want to do was the work required for
their paycheck, and then they were off to live that really important personal
life away from the job. That is probably not fair, but it sure seemed that way
in some of the meetings I attended.

Some would say there is nothing wrong with this. You are paid to do
exactly the job you were hired to do. Your personal life is not part of
that, and you deserve that personal life.

True! But, you can manage to do your job well, and still have a fine
personal life. Balancing those two aspects of your life is critical to
being a happy, productive, person! It is all in how you approach your
life!

Approaches to Your Working Life
*******************************

Unless you were born into wealth and do not need to work, you will be getting a
job at some point. You need to prepare for that working life early. That is why
we go to school, to learn the skills we will need to do the work we will do.

While I was growing up, I saw two kinds of approaches to a working life. (I am
sure there are others!)

One involved deep learning. You pick something and learn all there is to
know about that one thing. You become an expert in that one thing, and you
excel at doing that one thing. Cool! We need experts, right?

The other involved shallower learning about multiple things. You learned
each thing one well enough to be a wise user of that thing, but you could not
claim to know everything about that thing. What you could do, though, is stand
back and see how that one thing connects to some other thing. Your
skills were broad, not necessarily deep.

Which is better?

I am in that second group. My interests do not stop with one thing. I am
curious, and I want to know about a bunch of things. As I explore those
things, I am looking for connections. 

..  note::

    There was a really cool TV show in the late 1970s with just that
    title: "Connections". In that show, James Burke took a modern
    scientific invention and walked through the history of science to
    show how it came about.  Some of the paths to that invention were amazing,
    and very unexpected. It took a lot of curious folks in history to see the
    possibilities of one thing, which led to another thing, and so on! I have
    always wanted to be that kind of person!

So, while sitting in those meetings, I am probably paying attention to all of
the discussions, not just the ones involving my work. I am learning about my
organization, and looking for ways to improve the whole organization, and not
just the small part of it that my job covers. Surprisingly, I have managed to
make an impact on most of my organizations by doing this! I also became someone
my bosses would come to when they had questions about a variety of topics. That
was pretty cool!

Some organizations encourage that kind of thinking, some do not. Some even
actively discourage that kind of thinking from their employees. It might cause
change, and change scares the pants off of some folks! My feeling is
that the narrower your life view is, the more you are going to fear (or
ignore) change!

History Lesson
**************

As an example of what can happen if you only focus on one skill, here is a
story.

You probably drive a car, right? (Or at least you ride in one often
enough). How important are the brakes on that thing?

When I was a kid, my family never had much money, and for much of my
growing up we had no family car. We rode the bus. I had no idea when, or
even if, I would own a car, so my best bet was to share in my friend's
car dreams.

I remember my classmate's car discussions. They could not wait to get
their first car. They were dreaming about the huge engine their car
would have, and how fast it could go. Brakes? They were for sissies.

Going fast was what it was all about, and they could see nothing else.
They were going to have fast cars, and be the coolest kids around!

Sure, I liked going fast, but Mario Andretti taught me a lesson I never
forgot:

    Going fast is just one part of racing, stopping fast is just as
    important!

What?
=====

Back around 1978, I was standing along the fence at the Mid-Ohio race track,
watching an open-wheel car race. Mario was there, and I wanted to see him
drive!  Mario was a well known driver, competing in all kinds of races. I
followed his career a bit, but this was the first (and only) time I got to see
him race in person.

My friends and I took up a position at the end of a two-mile long
straight section, where the cars got up to full speed, around 200
miles per hour! The evil track designers put a 180 degree hairpin turn
at the end of that straight section! All those speeding cars had to slow down
to get through that turn!

We were standing at exactly the spot where most driver's came off the
throttle and hit the brakes. We started measuring the driver's skills by
where they were when we heard the power end and the braking start. It
was fun, and amazing.

Most of the drivers started braking right where we were, and they
struggled to get through that turn without running off the track into the
grass. 

Then came Mario.

He was on the throttle right up to our position. We expected him to start
braking. He did not. He kept on the throttle until we were sure we had seen the
last of him! Then he braked, and breezed through the turn with no problems. He
did this lap after lap, and we were stunned.  He made it look so easy, and he
won the race.

Mario realized that brakes were just as important as the engine, and he had
learned how to work both to maximum effect. He knew how to combine those two
aspects of his car to do the best job he could! He also understood how his
tires worked, and how to "stick" to the track! He could do everything needed to
succeed in racing, not just go fast! He went on the become the World Champion
Formula-1 Driver that same year! He was one of those rare learners who went
pretty deep into many things. He certainly did not focus on just one skill!

Deep Thinking and Drum Brakes
=============================

Early brakes were called drum brakes. They were constructed using a cast iron
shell in the form of a shallow drum attached to each wheel. Inside that drum
brake pads were forced onto the drum side surface when the driver hit the
brakes. The friction between the pads and the drum was what slowed the car
down.

Most of the time.

When those pads got wet, they did not work so well. Folks would hit the
brakes, but the car would keep on sailing along. Not good.

Then technology came up with a better brake. This one had a metal disk
sandwiched between two sets of brake pads. The system put pressure
on both sides of the brake disk and greatly improved the efficiency of
the brake. 

Great advance, and much better. We should all have disk brakes, right?

Wrong.

More Meetings
=============

I would have loved to sit through some of these meetings. The car
companies of the day had invested a lot of money in building drum brake
systems for the millions of cars they built. Those brake plants were
humming along nicely, and they were profitable. The deep-thinkers knew
drum brakes systems very well, and they were definitely not interested
in changing things! It does not make "economic sense", was their battle
cry.

Time for my favorite saying:

    We never have time to do things right, but we always have time to do
    the same things over!

In the end, it took an act of Congress (in the name of public safety) to
force the car manufacturers to move to disk brakes.

Sometimes, getting something to change in your organization will feel
like it takes an act of congress to achieve! I am pretty sure that part
of the reason why has to do with the differences in how we live our
lives. For some, change threatens their lives, and they resist change
unless forced to make it happen. Others see change as an opportunity to
do things better, to move our society forward. These change-embracing folks may
actually fear a lack of change, seeing it as stagnation!

There has to be a balance between these two groups.

Back to non-learning
********************

Mario wanted to be a great driver, and he succeeded! His skills as a driver
covered so many aspects of automotive technology, it is astounding! He was not
a one-skill, deep learning person. He was a driver with broad interests, who
learned a lot about many aspects of his field, and learned how they worked
together. What made Mario even more impressive, was he managed to keep his
skills as a driver relevant through several decades of advances in racing
technology! He definitely did not fear change. He met the challenge of a
changing world, and did quite well at it. I suspect he taught his kids that
lesson well, since we are in the third generation of Andretti racers!

If your skills are limited to one special thing, you will end up fearing
change, especially change that means your skill is no longer needed!

Change
======

Change will happen, whether you want it to or not. You need to keep one eye
(Hmmm, I only have one eye these days!) on the world around you, if you intend
to get a nice career going. I am afraid some of those I have worked with were
not looking around them, and they sure did not seem to be looking toward the
future. I simply choose not to join in with them, especially when they refuse
to support change. Those folks do not seem interested in advancing the
organization's goals, just maintaining their own lifestyle. I am definitely not
going to do that!

I have never feared that change would invalidate my skills. I keep updating my
skills. I spend a lot of time reading, studying, exploring ideas, just
to make sure my skill set stays sound. I also make sure I can speak to the changes
that are going to happen around my organization. By doing this, I have been
able to become an advisor to many (most) of my bosses, something I am
pretty proud of! I even got to serve on advisory committees at the
Congressional Level, something that amazed me at the time. (That is
until I had to work closely with some of those political critters that
surround Congressmen! But that is another story!)

Balancing Personal Life and the Job
***********************************

But what about that personal life? How to these two very different kinds of
people balance personal and professional lives?

The deep-learner may well spend a lot of time learning that one thing they do
so well. But eventually, they will reach a point where they have mastered that
thing. Unless it changes (which they will resist) they are done with learning.
Their books on the thing will start to get old, and basically, they do not need
to spend much time learning any more. What they need to do is protect that one
thing!. 

Great! That leaves more time for the personal stuff. That must be nice,
especially if you love to go fishing, or play a lot of golf. You have plenty of
time for all that.

So maybe this is a good thing. 

Unfortunately, I do not like fishing or golf. So I am stuck!

The shallow learner has a lot of ground to explore. A lot of that "personal"
time is going to go into that exploration, so their ability to separate work
from personal things may well suffer. That is certainly a risk, but I think
there is a solution.

All you have to do is pick a career field you really enjoy, so the work you do
is fun. 

Simple, right!

Not so simple for a lot of young people, it seems. They have a hard time
finding something to focus their lives on. I was very lucky. I picked my career
in Aerospace Engineering when I was eight years old! It was a fine choice, but
my shallow-learning tendencies made my choice morph into computer science.
Still it was fun!

As happens with most professionals, as my career moved on, I was moved into
management. I have always hated that term. To me is is a deep-thinking term.
Managing implies maintaining things, stagnation. I prefer leadership, I want
to help lead the way to the future!

As a "manager" I was the boss over a lot of people. In my last assignment in
the Air Force, I was the boss of over 125 people. I had a staff of lower level
managers to help with all of that!

I used to tell my folks that if they were not having fun doing what they were
doing, they were probably in the wrong job! I tried to make sure they had the
resources they needed to do their jobs, and I fought to make sure the pressures
on them were reasonable. I was the interface between my bosses and them!

What? Another Meeting?
**********************

I held a lot of meetings as the boss. Meetings are about checking on how things
are going, and planning for the future of the organization. To be a productive
member of the group, you have to be prepared for a meeting. You have to know
what is going on, and have a vision of the future. As is usual in many
organizations, I had a mix of deep and shallow thinkers. Their ways of dealing
with change showed up when things got tough. Some would fight to protect the
status-quo. Others could see what was happening, and worked to do the best they
could with the changes that were coming.

Unfortunately, in some of my meetings people only saw the future in terms of
where they would be in that future. Others saw the future in terms of where the
organization was going. To me, the best employees were the ones  who focused on
what change would mean for our customers. Those were the folks who produced the
best results for the organization. Their reward usually came in the form of
promotions, or more responsibilities (which some see as a bad thing. Wait, that
is those deep thinkers again!)


The Next Generations
********************

It seems that focusing on your career is not very popular with today's
students. Their vision of the future is measured in the things they want to do,
places they want to go, toys they want to acquire. (Or worse, in terms of how
may friends they have on Facebook!) Their happiness seems to be measured by
these things.

It is sad to see young folks who have no vision at all of what they want to do
in this world. I was very fortunate to have role models who valued serving
others above serving themselves. Those who lack a sound vision of the future
need to be guided by someone, or they will end up living much less of this life
we have than they could. 

I was taught that if you did your job well, all those things you might like to
get out of life will be your reward! You are not "entitled" to them outright!
You have to earn those things by making a contribution!  Now, it seems that the
job is just a means to an end. It is a way to earn the money needed for those
really "important" things. I have made my career working for organizations
whose mission was to help people in real ways.  My vision of success was that
my organizations succeeded really well, and I played a significant role in
that success!

The problem with this new generation of employees seems to be that they center
their attention on themselves, not on their contributions to this world they
live in. I believe that living the non-learning life leads to a limited view of
the world, and your ability to make a significant contribution to that world
will be limited as well.

If you disagree with this, that is surely your right. But be careful! Your
single, deep learned skill, the one you depend on to fund your "real" life, may
cease to be of interest to anyone. If you are lucky, you will reach retirement
before that happens. If not, well, good luck with that.

What Now?
*********

My problem for now is simple. I am old enough to retire, but I have so much of
this world left to explore and learn about, I cannot see retirement. I love the
idea that I get to teach a new generation about this world, and, hopefully,
show them the cool connections out there waiting to be explored. I still want
to turn them into the kind of people who will make a real difference in this
world.

Every once in a while I get an email from a former student telling me I am on
track. That makes for a great day!

Family Life
***********

We were not meant to live this life alone, no matter which path your life
takes. If you are fortunate, as I have been, you will find someone to
accompany on your journey through life. That companion deserves a chunk of your
time, so be sure you carve off enough of whatever you do for them. Sometimes
that is tough to do. It is essential, and do not forget that.

My companion in this life is much like me, she is a professional who struggles
to find time for things other than the job. We both enjoy being together, and
doing hobby things, and traveling. Some would say we are both workaholics, and
they may be right. But I think we both feel that what awe re doing is helping
others, and that is why we keep at it!

Your Challenge
**************

Don't let your approach to life keep you focused on the wrong things. I believe
we are here to make a contribution to the world we will leave behind. It ain't
about the toys you gain during your life, it is about the people you leave
behind who will remember you as someone who made a difference in their lives.
That is something cool, and worth working hard to accomplish!

A Final Note
************

In spite of my belief that the goals of these two kinds of people are very
different, there is no rule that you must be one or the other. Neither is it
clear that one lifestyle is better than another. You get to choose! That is
what freedom is really about.

I chose my path. I will never view my job as something to do until it is time to
do those other things in life. I know a lot of people who live their lives just
that way, though. They seem happy enough. But then I look to see who they have
inspired, and what they will leave behind. I do not like what I see. I strive
for more than that.

But that is just me!
