I like to engage my fellow human beings in conversations that take them to
unexpected places. Most of the itme, it gets a laugh!

7-11
****

My local 7-11 store has a really annoying doorbell that goes "ding-dong"
whenever the door opens. I was standing at he counter, staring at an add for a
7-11 app for my iPhone:

"If I open that app, does it go ding-dong like it does in here?"

"I never thought of that"

"We should rename this store the Ding-Dong store!"

"I know, it drives me nuts!"

"If I worked here, a 45 would take care of that. This is Texas after all!"

Dr. Scholl's Office
*******************

On my last visit with Dr. Scholl to check on my hearing once again, he had me
tested and found no real change in my ear mecanics, but the tube he put in my
eardrum was clogged, so he pulled the old one out. He asked if I wante to put
another one in. Since I survived the last installation, I agreeded to the
procedure. When the nurse came to get me for the procedure:

"I suppose it would not be politically correct if I yelled 'No, No Dr. Scholl!
Not the knife again!' loud enough that the folks in the waiting room could
hear!"

"Well, we would all get to go home early!"

Then to Dr. Scholl:

"I suppose I should take out my hearing aide so I can't hear you say 'Oh Damn'
while you are doing this!"

Best Buy
********

I do not know why, but every time I go up to a checkout counter:

"Did you find everything?"

"Do you know how long it would take to find everything? Besides if you want me
to do an inventory, you are going to have to pay me!"

I usually get a blank stare at that! 

All of these come from listening to what folks say, and thinking about the
words literally. We often do not think about how silly some things we say
really are!

Just me having fun!

(Or being annoying!)
