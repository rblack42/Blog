Sorry folks, I spent WAY too much time in the Air Force. They create acronyms
out of everything. That one stands for *Yet Another M.D. Anderson CT Scan*. I
am guessing I have had over 20 of these things.

12:34pm
*******

(Slowly the doorknob opens)

In walks Dr. Lai's Assistant in a white lab code (naturally!)

"How are we doing today?"

(I resist the temptation to use my standard reply: That is for you to know and
me to find out!. Instead, Cheryl says:)

"You are supposed to tell us!"

"Well, I have the CT scan report, and it says 'No significant findings
indicating a recurrence'"

(Sound of happy feet doing a dance).

Just what we wanted to hear! YEAH!

Wow, that` was fast. We had the scan late yesterday!

Driving over
************

Most of these three month checks take two days to do. I had to cancel classes
on two days, which is tough for a teacher to do, but i have no choice. The scan
has to take priority!

Our first appointment was at 9:30am, so Cheryl and I headed out of Austin at
5:00am. (No, the sun was not up, it is smarter than that!)

Surprisingly, there was not much traffic in Austin. That is very rare around
here. We sailed out of town, through Bastrop (scene of a massive wildfire a few
years ago), and got to La Grange for a kolache stop by 6:00. That is pretty
quick, but we needed the stop, since neither of us had breakfast. The kloaches
there are marvelous!

Another two hours and we are smack in the middle of Houston rush hour. We
crawled along for quite a while, and finally made it to MDA!. Only this time,
the line into the parking garage was huge, and going nowhere. Cheryl had a
great thought: valet parking! That was something we did on our very first
visit, but have not done since. Turns out it costs three dollars more to use
that service rather than parking in the garage, so we decided to go for it and
left the line and were in the hospital with enough time to make the first
appointment just fine.

Plastics
********

The first stop was a visit with Dr. Yu, my plastic surgeon there. Dr. Lai
wanted him to revisit my sagging mouth issue, which is causing me to drool
excessively. Almost anything I try to put in my mouth immediately heads back
out along the drooping side. I cannot feel it,! However, when my shirt gets
messy, I do notice it, and Cheryl is constantly pointing out escaping whatever.
The whole situation is very annoying, and I am actively seeking some kind of
solution.

Dr. Yu, and my Austin plastics doctor, both agree that fixing the lips just is not
going to work. They would have to steal ligaments from my arm to hold the lips
up, and that would only work for a period of time and the problem would come
back! So that is not going to be a solution.

I had an idea about building some kind of dam out of rubber or plastic that I
could wedge between my lips and the artificial gum they built when they rebuilt
my jaw during the last surgery. I visited with Dr. McMordie, who build
appliances for my first two surgeries, to discuss this idea, and he thought we
might be able to do something. He said he could build a dental plate that tied
into the remaining teeth on the right side, and hung out into the area along my
new jawbone. He said it would be an experiment and it might not work. I wanted
Dr. Yu's opinion on that idea before trying it.

But, after thinking about it, the engineer in me got upset at one aspect of
this idea. With nothing to support that new plate, any pressure in it would
transfer directly to the remaining teeth on the other side (like a see-saw).
That would stress those teeth badly, and I do not want to lose them!

The waiting area where we sit before visiting Dr. Yu is one of Cheryl's
favorites. The fish tank there has very friendly fish, who always seem to come
over to her when she gets close up.

For some reason, they were not a friendly as usual. Probably because they just
finished eating, and they knew she had nothing to offer them.

We were called in to the small waiting room (with one of those door knobs) in
short order, and were greeted by Dr. Yu's P.A, Brooke, who hails from Nebraska,
so Cheryl and Brooke spent a few minutes discussing football! (Go figure!). Me?
I just sat there waiting for my turn.

Brooke looked me over, declared that everything they had done looked fine, and
wandered off to find Dr. Yu.

Dr Yu, in a blue bow tie, showed up very quickly, and also declared that all of
his work looked fine.

Then we started discussing options to deal with my mouth. He came up with a
different solution, Maybe we could construct implant that would replace the
teeth they took out from my lower jaw. There is enough bone in there (thanks to
my left leg) to support such a thing, so he suggested contacting Dr. Hofsted
(who spotted my last tumor) and see what she thought!

Wow! We never suspected there might be a better solution!. So, we called over
to the dental clinic to see if we could get a follow-up visit scheduled there.

We were out of Dr. Yu's area with new things to think about around 10:30.

My next appointment was at 3:40pm, so we had time to head to some place to get
a bit of email checking done. We ended up on a walkway between buildings that
spans the major road that goes by MDA. That gave us something to watch, in
addition to people watching, which is always "interesting" at MDA!

We skipped lunch, since I was not allowed to eat before the CT scan. When it got
close to time for the scan, we headed to the vampire feeding area. They needed
lunch, so I donated a few gallons of blood! (Well, it seemed like that much!)
Then we headed up an escalator to the CT waiting area and did just that, waited.
After about 45 minutes I was called in to get the IV set up (no fun, as usual),
and went back out to the waiting area to wait some more. Finally, I got called
in and was taken to yet another waiting area, where i got to sit for almost an
hour. At least in that room, they gave me a microwaved warm blanket. (Why are
hospitals always freezing?) The scan itself was not any different from the
others, but they use an automated IV push machine to inject a "contrast" die
that makes things show up more clearly. When that thing kicked in, it hurt! No
where near as much as a past one where I thought my arm was going to explode,
but it was bad enough! I survived the injection, then the pain faded and was
replaced by an internal heat stroke that extends from head to toe. That stuff
is just weird!

Then it was over.

Dinner 
******

On this trip, we decided to stay with Cheryl's high school classmate, Sharon,
and her husband Dan, who we often visit on these trips. I got to bond with
Little Bits, their wired little doggie, who is a ball of energy. She remembered me
from my last visit, and was my best friend immediately.

We ate way too much food at Olive Garden and I crashed for the evening fairly
early. Sharon and Cheryl were talking about their upcoming high school reunion,
so they kept at it a bit longer.

Back to MDA
***********

Next morning, we took Sharon to the airport so she could go back to Nebraska
for a visit (that seems to happen with folks from Nebraska a lot. They seem to
need to return for a fix of some sort periodically. The best of all fixes
involves going to a Cornhusker football game, but that is VERY hard to do!
They have sold that stadium out for every home game for *centuries*, (or so I
am told!)

Next thing I know, we are back at MDA. In the parking garage this time. On
level 11 (a new record). That place is busy!

This appointment, with Dr. Lai, is the most important one, since he normally
looks over the CT scan images, and gives us his "unofficial" opinion. This
time, we got the official reading right away, which was great news.

New Issues
**********

The CT scan showed a few issues we had not been thinking about. It appears that
the main carotid arteries going up my neck, where the radiation occurred, are
showing signs of closing down a bit. Dr. Lai said things like this are common, but
he suggested that I get a Doppler scan of my neck to get a better look at this.
Great, more stuff to worry about. The CT scan report also noted the damage
caused by my stroke. I expected that, but I was hoping it might magically clear
up. No signs of that happening, so this may well be the new me permanently! Oh
well, I am getting used to it.

Dr. Lai was done very quickly. We told him of Dr. Yu's suggestion, and he was
eager for us to explore that idea. Fortunately, we managed to get an
appointment set up for right after this visit, so we left Dr. Lai and that evil
door knob, and headed to the dental area.

Dental Plan
***********

We got in to see Dr. Hofsted pretty quickly. One of her lab technicians took
me into an X-Ray room for a 360 degree image of what is left of my head
(including the few teeth left there). Then it was back into another small room
to wait.

Dr Hofsted came in and we talked a bit about how I was recovering, and she
inspected my "flap", the skin they put inside my mouth to replace my gum. 

Then we got down to business. She had looked over the X-Ray and decided I was a
good candidate for an implant. She suggested installing two metal posts into the
bone (my leg bone) and waiting a couple of months for that to heal. Then they
will rework the flap to expose the top of the posts, and bolt on a row of teeth!
No of that denture stuff, this would sit there full time and give me back my
left lower jaw. She even proposed a removable plate that would add back in a
few of my upper teeth. All in all, that would restore my mouth to what it was
before the jawbone surgery - almost.

It will take two out-patient surgeries to get all of this done, and we
discussed doing the first one after classes end in mid-December.

I got a good look at what they did to replace my jaw, and I really am turning
into a bionic man!. The entire left lower jawbone is gone. Where it was, they
put in what looked like a bicycle chain, really a piece of titanium with places
to put screws as needed. They can form this chunk of metal as they like, and
they curved it to match my old jaw line. 

On top of that metal, they took the leg bone and cut it into three pieces and
bolted them in place to form a line of bone that looks like the original bone.
On top of that bone sits the flap, pretending to be a gum. Only thing missing
is teeth. It looks pretty amazing. It is also easy to see what they are
planning. Just insert the posts into the bone, which is still "alive" and it
will grow around them, locking them in place. Then they will form the dental
pate they will bolt onto those posts. It will not move at all, so it might just
work well enough to stop (or minimize) my drooling issues. Time will tell!

Hey, this is a HUGE improvement opportunity, totally unexpected. Both Cheryl
and I were pretty happy with the prospects!

We left with a plan for my doctors to discuss this, since the surgery will
involve both plastics and dental work, but it looks like we will be going for
it!

Microcenter
***********

We left MDA around 3:00pm, and headed for the requisite stop at Microcenter so
I could buy a few new toys for my students to play with. After that, we headed
for home.

Oh yeah, we did stop at Dairy Queen for blizzards to celebrate. We also stopped
in La Grange for a kolache resupply!

Then we were home, around 7:30pm.

We had a long two days, and were both crashed as the stress of the trip faded. 

It takes me a while to adjust to the new situation. I believe that every
patient who sits in those evil waiting rooms, waiting  for test results,
actually expects the worst. You almost have to, so you are prepared if it turns
out bad. I have actually been OK with the news, even when it was bad. Knowing
is far better than not knowing. 

When the news is good, it still takes a while for it to settle in. I went to
bed last night just starting to feel like things were going to be fine. At
least for another three months, then we do this all over again!

Such is the life of cancer patients. No fun, but something that must be endured!

Prayers
*******

As usual, Cheryl sent out a flurry of text messages to all those who have been
praying for both of us during this trip. She got over thirty replies almost
immediately! That is amazing, and we both thank all of you. I have said it
before, and will continue to say it again: this journey would be almost
impossible to survive all by yourself. With Cheryl's help, and all of those out
there" supporting us as well, we are doing pretty well. We have all of you to
thank for that.

Oh, and God, of course. He was pretty good to us on this trip. We thanked him
especially for that!
