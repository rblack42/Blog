3AM at M.D. Anderson

No one gets much sleep at M.D. Anderson! 

Here I am, at Version 5.0, hanging out with my night nurse, Yesinia (whose
parents got the idea for her name from a Soap Opera! Parents sure come up with weird
names for their poor kids!)

Yesinia has been working on cleaning up my chest area. I ended up having a
tracheotomy as part of round four surgery, and when I cough, which happens a
lot, I end up with "crud" (that is the technical term for it) on my chest.
Yesinia is almost an artist at doing this cleanup. She wields a water-soaked
sponge-tipped stick like a brush as she works off the goo from painful areas
around incisions and other places the doctors have "modified" to build this new
version. She is good, but it takes a while.

Good thing we have all night. 

She also has to check out the Doppler pinger that proves there is good blood
flow in the "flap" they put in to cover part of my new jawbone! That "flap"
used to be part of my leg. Exactly what part I have not figured out yet. There
are several possibilities from what I can feel! With the Doppler sensor, you can
hear blood flow in both directions through the new tissue they grafted into
place on the new jawbone they are growing in the area.

Dr. Yu has a world-wide reputation for doing this kind of magic work, and I am
extremely lucky to be one of his patients!

Surgery Day
***********

In my last post, we had settled into our favorite La Quinta off route 59 in
Houston. We set the alarms(s) (you need more than one this time) for 3:45AM so
we could get ready and drive over to the hospital by 5:15AM, when I was to
report for surgery.

We were the first ones in the waiting area. Cheryl, Connie, Karen, and I all
sat there while I filled out the requisite ton of paperwork needed to get
ready for surgery. Soon, there were many other folks doing exactly the same thing,
with varying numbers of folks waiting with them.

At around 5:30AM, an orderly came out and had us all line up to wander into the
surgery prep area. Last time I had surgery here, we ended up in a curtained off
cubical. This time we each had private rooms, with a bed, TV, and everything needed
to get ready.

They had me strip down and put on the blue "BHO" gown (Butt Hanging Out, in
case you do not know proper hospital acronyms!)

Once that was done, a constant stream of doctors, nurses, trash collectors,
etc, started streaming into the room::

    "Patient ID" "1234567"
    "Name" "me"
    "Did you?" "np"
    "Have you", "no"
    "Will you? "never, I promise!"

The questions were identical to those on forms I filled out back in the waiting
area. It must be some kind of test!

Our PA came in and wrote YES on one leg, and NO on the other one, after asking
me which side they would be operating on. Hope I answered her right! She also
wrote on my face as well. I guess enough doctors have been burned by making a
mistake in surgery that this is now common practice!

Finally, the evil person with the needle came in and they set up the IV. This
one went very well. Either I was so preoccupied by things or he was very good.
I never felt the needle going in!

Good!

Karen and Connie had to swap out while all of this was going on, since they
only allow two family members in the room at any one time.

Time to Go!
***********

I had some general ideas about  what might happen but did not know exactly what
would happen during this surgery. The doctors would figure things out as they
worked on me.

All I remember next was being told they were going to start the IV. I kissed
Cheryl goodbye, and we said we would meet up again in recovery. I have a vague
memory of the bed starting to move, then it was lights out!

I do not remember anything until I woke up in a recovery area.

Eight Hours had gone by

The Surgery
***********

Apparently, two teams worked on me at the same time. Dr. Lai's team was at my
head, working on making the cancer go away, and Dr. Yu's team was working on my
legs, trying to find parts he would need to rebuild things in my mouth when Dr. Lai
got finished.

Once more, more of my leg was going to end up in my mouth. Fortunately not my
foot, although that has happened a time or two in my past!

Dr. Lai would work a little, then wait for lab results to tell them how to
proceed next.

In the end, they took my entire lower left jawbone out. I knew this might
happen, and the doctors agreed that, based on my history, this was the best way
to go. If they left any bone in that area that has microscopic cancer cells in
it, going back in later would be much more difficult. So they went for the
easier, and safer, alternative.

Dr Yu had to rebuild a jawbone out of pieces of my left leg bone and tissue he
stole from the same leg!

Artificial Jaw
**************

Look up Roger Ebert to see what I might have had to deal with. He was a movie
critic back in the 1980s who lost his entire lower jawbone to the same kind of
cancer I have. I saw an interview with him before he finally died from this
cancer, so I was not happy with the thought that I might follow him down the
same path.

But Dr. Yu is a master of this kid of work, and he had another idea.

Basically, he took three pieces of bone from the non-weight-bearing part of
my left leg and built up a new jawbone structure out of that. He braced those
bone fragments with a titanium plate and screws to hold everything together as
the bone grows back into place, and covered everything up with tissue and blood
vessels from my leg as well. It will all heal giving me a mouth that looks
reasonable.

Except I have no teeth on that side now. Maybe we can fix that later, 

The surgery was difficult, and took a long time to complete. Cheryl had to
endure another painful waiting process. But the hospital staff is great about
keeping family informed about the progress, and this time Cheryl had family with
her, so that much was easier for her.

Me? I slept through the whole thing and woke up on the eleventh floor in a
private recovery room.

Recovery Time
*************

That is when I found out they had stuffed in so much new material into my mouth
that I could not breathe normally. So they added a tracheotomy.

The expected time in recovery is about a week, during which time they work on
getting you through the pain part of the process, and get you walking again.
You have to learn how to eat again as well, much of that is going on through a
feeding tube they put in my nose.

I have to deal with physical therapists (aka torturers) who make you put weight
on the injured leg to help things heal properly!

And watch a bunch of weird TV shows. M.D. Anderson is a world-wide center, with
patients from all over. They have TV stations from most regions of the world.
Actually, it  does not matter what language they are speaking on most of those
channels. I am convinced there is no intelligent life anywhere in TV-Land!

Still, at 3AM is it nice to have something to watch, even if it is a station
from Kuwait!

Feeding Time
************

I have been working on this long enough that there has been a shift change. My
nurse now is Miranda (who probably cannot sing a country song, but she is a
great nurse! She also has five kids, ranging from 4 to 14! Yikes, she does not
look that old at all. Her husband is a doctor here, but his family was from
Milan, Italy. Quite an International place, this M.D. Anderson!

I am sleepy enough to need a nap. Since Miranda just fed me, that probably is
making me sleepy as well. I will add more to this version of the story in a few days!

In the meantime, thanks to all of you who are praying for us as we work through
this adventure. We could not survive this battle without you.

BTW, the ward filled up last night with several emergencies and a few more
surgeries contributing new patients. I loaned a few prayers to those new folks.
We are all in this battle together. I hope none of you mind! God's hands are
big enough for us all!
