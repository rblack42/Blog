Another Ticket Punch

As I have said before, I live in 3-4 month increments. Last week, Cheryl and I
made our standard pilgrimage to Houston for yet another CT scan, and doctor
visit. We both pray that the cancer is gone, and we will find nothing new on
these trips!

The appointments started at 9:30am on Wednesday, so we rolled out of bed at 4am
that morning to get ready, and headed out WAY before the sun came up. Even
though this is a three hour drive, we have done it so often, we do not seem to
notice how long it takes.

Once again, as we sailed through the Texas countryside around La Grange, the
morning fog layer was sitting close to the ground, raising up about 20 feet. It
might have reminded us of snow back in Nebraska. It was kind of neat, and
cleared as the sun came up. 

We have found a route that gets us to the hospital pretty quickly, so we arrived
at our standard parking garage in good time. We usually guess what level we
will end up on, I guessed six, but it ended up nine. The higher we end up we go
the busier M.D. Anderson is, so that was not a good sign. The place was pretty
busy, and this time our first appointments were not in the main building, but
over in the Mays Clinic. That meant we had to take a ride on their "train" that
connects major buildings in the complex. 

We signed in for the requisite vampire feeding, and I was called in pretty
quickly. The technician assured me they were not vampires, but rather "walking
dead" (WAY too many of these silly shows on TV it seems!) I suspect either
image is not really appropriate for this place, but it does lighten what would
be a too somber mood otherwise. 

The blood tests went quickly. I am losing my aversion to being stuck with that
nasty needle, and then we went up an elevator to the CT imaging area. Once again, I
got in and out with little fuss. The IV setup was a bit different, I had two
techs working at the same time. I suspect it was a variation on the good cop -
bad cop routine. One talked to me on one side, while the other one stuck
needles in me on the other. I hardly noticed when they did that! I did do
my standard "wait fifteen seconds, then say 'ouch'" routine. It got a laugh! 

My only problem with this CT test was that the machine seemed pretty old, and
this clinic was not as nicely set up as my normal area. No pictures on the
wall, or scenery on the ceiling to stare at as you ride through the "do-nut"
machine. Oh well, it went smoothly.

On the way to our next appointment, we stopped in the Reconstruction Clinic
where my plastic surgeon doctor left a letter explaining why I had metal in my
face, just in case it triggered something in a TSA checkpoint. We were going to
fly to Virginia on Friday, and thought this would be a good idea. Security at
airports was reported to be pretty high level!

Eye Checks
**********

My vision continues to be something I am concerned about. With only one eye,
and that one affected by the stroke, I want to make sure we have done
everything possible to prevent further damage, and make sure we are doing
everything possible to improve things. I asked to see one of their
ophthalmologists on this visit, so that was the next stop.

The doctor who saw us gave my eye a very good look, but in the end said there
was nothing he could see to indicate we could do anything we were not already
doing. He did say that their standard protocol for dealing with strokes like this
is to see a Neurologist to prevent another stroke. We left it that I would see
about doing this back in Austin. We were both disappointed there was no magic
switch he could throw to make my vision better. I guess I can deal with this.
As usual, I really have no choice!

Dinner with Friends
*******************

Cheryl's High School classmate, Sharon and her husband Dan, just got back from
a trip to Paris, so we scheduled dinner with them to see here 500+ pictures
from the trip! Aren't digital cameras neat? We used to take a week long trip
and come back with two rolls of 16 pictures, now we can come back with
thousands of pictures if we like! Then you get to spend days cataloging all of
those, trying to remember what was going on when you took them. I can foresee a
day when we will wear a digital hats, armed with cameras, GPS, and voice
recorders, and all we need to do is walk around talking to ourselves, and the
whole experience will be recorded for you to spend an equal amount of time
watching on TV later. Shoot, maybe we are moving toward the cruise ships shown
in Wall-EE, remember those?

Their pictures were neat, and reminded us of our honeymoon trip there almost 20
years ago! (We need to go back!). It was a nice evening. I even got to reconnect
with their dog, Little-Bits!

Microcenter
***********

Our first appointment on Thursday was not until 3pm, so we had a leisurely
morning in the motel, then visited my favorite Microcenter. We had time to
explore this place, since we were in no hurry. Usually we want to get home when
we stop here, so the visits are short. 

I bought a few toys, and we headed to the Barnes and Noble for another time
waster. We stopped at a nearby Mexican restaurant for lunch, then headed back
to M.D. Anderson.

Nutrition
*********

The first stop was with a nutritionist we saw on our last visit. She wanted to
do another check to see how things are going.  We went over my issues in eating,
and my swallow issues. I am making progress there, so she was happy with
things, and said we did not need to see her unless something new came up later.
She did recommend a nutrition planner "app" that she uses on her iPhone. It was
pretty cool, it made suggestions on meals based on several criteria, like
"quick", or "low carb", then created a basic shopping list for you that you
could customize if you had some of the items. Then it gave you the final
shopping list to take with you to the store. It looked neat enough that we may
try it out soon.

The Verdict
***********

FINALLY!

Our last stop of the day was with my primary surgeon, Dr. Lai. As usual, he was
pretty busy, and our scheduled appointment time came and went. We sat in the
waiting area for almost two hours before we were called back into that small
room with the door knob I have mentioned before.

There it was, and there we were, waiting for it to move.

Finally it did, and one of Dr. Lai's assistants came in. He looked me over, and
listened to my concerns about eating (and drooling), and finally told us he had
looked at the CT scans, and they saw nothing!

YEAH!

I could hear the punch machine - registering another three months. Cheryl and I
shared a glance saying we were both relieved! Praying for this worked!

The assistant left, and a few minutes later, Dr. Lai came in and we talked
about how things were going. Dr. Lai agreed with my plan to see my plastic
surgeon in Austin to explore options for my face. 

Just before this Houston visit, I met with the dentist who built two appliances
used to help me through my first surgeries for cancer, now over eight years
ago. In that visit, we came up with an idea for an appliance that might create
a "dam" that could help prevent food and drink from drooling out of my mouth.
Dr. Lai agreed with that plan. We will explore that after I see the plastic
surgeon in Austin. 

Back Home
*********

We were done! And, the trip was a success! We were going to celebrate with a
Blizzard at Dairy Queen, but the place was closed for remodeling. So, we ate at
a Sonic instead, and then drove back to Austin as quickly as we could. We had
an early trip to make to Virginia coming up in the morning, and we had to
unpack and repack for that!

As usual, we are both grateful for all the support we get, from readers of this
blog, and from friends and family who check in with Cheryl while I am in the
back rooms working through all the technical stuff surrounding cancer
treatments! I is never any fun for us, and is stressful, to say the least. All
of this support helps, and we both want to make sure we thank you for that.

Next up, getting old(er) and revisiting High School back in Virginia!
