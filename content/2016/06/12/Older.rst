When I was a kid, looking at people who were OLD, I could not imagine I would
ever look like that. Of course, back then old was thirty-something. I graduated
from George Mason High School, in Falls Church, Virginia in 1964. Two years
ago, my class had its 50th reunion back in Falls Church, and we had a
great time. So, one of my classmates, Phil Quam and his wife Debbie, invited
the class to his place in Virginia Beach to celebrate all of us turning 70 this
year. We had so much fun last time we met, a good sized bunch of use decided to
do just that!

Friday, Cheryl and I again got up at the crack of dawn, headed to the Austin
Airport and flew to Norfolk, Virginia.

Resort Hotel
************

We got to the Austin airport and through security with no problems. My face did
not set off any alarms! I was not expecting it to, but you never know. Our
first flight was from Austin to Dallas, and was quick and easy. We even made it
to the gate for the next leg just fine. But when it was time to board for that
flight, they could not get the back door on the plane to close properly, so we
sat, and sat, until they decided that plane was going nowhere. We boarded a
second plane about an hour and a half late, and took off for Norfolk. Another
nice flight and we were in Virginia.

We ended up renting a Toyota Corolla, something we knew all about, and drove a
short eight miles to the Virginia Beach Resort Hotel, right on the beach on the
Chesapeake Bay/James River side of the waterfront, just North from Virginia Beach
proper.

As I checked in, I spotted one of my classmates, John Ebert, sitting in the
lobby, and said "Hi" as I got the room keys. We got our stuff in the room, and
had only about an hour to get ready for the first event, dinner at at the
Lynnhaven Fish House less than a mile away, also on the beach.

There were about 15 of my classmates there, and we had a nice meal. I had
crab-cakes, something the Chesapeake Bay is famous for, Cheryl had a nice
serving of Salmon, and we sat and talked with new/old friends, some of whom I
had not seen in over 50 years. Needless to say, none of us looked like we did
way back when.

Catching up involved telling stories of what we did after school, meeting the
new spouses, hearing about jobs, kids, and travel experiences. It was fun.

My most nervous part was figuring out who all these people were! I knew all the
names, some better than others, but putting a name to a face was a tough
proposition. It is kind of embarrassing to have to ask someone their name, when
you spent several years of your life with them in school. But that is
part of what happens as you get older, so you get over it and press on. 

I sat next to a classmate, Doug Conner and his wife, Sherry, who did not make
it to the 50th, so I had seen him last at graduation! We talked a lot about his
travel, past and future. He and his wife missed the 50th because of a trip to
Florence, and I want to do that with Cheryl for our 20th Anniversary in a
couple of years, so we discussed where to go on that trip!. 

All in all it was a great evening, topped off with Key-Lime pie, another
treat.

Finally, after a very long day, we were back in the hotel for a good night's
sleep.

Aviation History
****************

Phil Quam , our host for this bash, knowing I am big into aviation history,
recommended that we visit the Military Aviation Museum in South Virginia Beach,
so we headed out there after lunch. That place is incredible! They have an
impressive collection of planes from World War I and II, and a few other craft
to boot. 

And they all fly!

As we arrived, there was a Messerschmidt ME-109 flying around. I have never
seen one of those in person, much less in the air. A lot of the other ships
were lined up along the grass strip, with folks wandering around them, getting
them ready to fly. Sadly, we could not stay long, so I could not see them all
in the air, but that place is a must for a revisit, and they do give rides in
several of them! Really cool place.

Here is the ME109:

And, here is a British Mosquito:

One of my professors at Virginia Tech flew for the Hungarian Air Force (for the
wrong side) during WWII. He used to tell tales of flying against this plane
over England. The entire craft is made of plywood! (Ok, there is a bit of metal
in there.) Metal was in short supply, and wood was readily available.

Party Time
**********

We arrived at Phil's place in plenty of time for the evening BBQ feast. The
crowd was bigger, since several drove down from the D.C. area just for the
dinner, then planned on heading back that night. Once again, we had a great
time visiting all these fine folks.

I am of the opinion that this class is unusual in a very good way. Many class
get-togethers are a sad affair. Too many memories, some of which might not be
that great, being revisited, and some feeling that they just did not belong
with this bunch any more. While it will always be true that the high-school
"cliques" will reform at a reunion, that is natural since those were the people
you spent the most time with, our group was definitely different.

We can thank one classmate in particular for that. Judy Ingalls, who as I recall was pretty
popular back then, set up a class website for our 50th reunion, and it morphed
into a vehicle for all of us to keep in touch through the past few years. We
have a message system that lets people tell stories, and connect with
classmates regardless of who you hung out with. We all have been getting to
know each other, pretty well through this website.

Here we are at the BBQ:

Unfortunately, I still have the face-name problem, and need to look at my
yearbook to make the connections. Still, as a group, we all get along just fine!
I am pretty happy to be a part of this bunch!

Cheryl has a 50th reunion coming up soon, and she and Judy are starting to work
on a plan to set up something similar for her class. I really hope we can do
that, since I think this is a great way to keep those old friends close. It is
a lot of fun to revisit old and new stories.

I will admit some of the stories I heard about football training back then made
me cringe. I am almost glad I was not a "jock" in school, preferring to study
technologies in the Smithsonian, and build model airplanes for contests around
the East Coast! I am amazed that some of my classmates lived to get to college
from the stories I heard! Wow!

I think we all missed those who could not come. My best friend, Ron Tinkham,
from back then could not come, and I was really looking forward to spending
time with him. There were others as well we all hoped would be able to come.
Some are fighting medical issues, either personally, or with family members, so
we all knew they were with us in spirit, and we were with them as well!

At the close of the event, we all had cake, courtesy of our hostess, Debbie
Quam, and we sang "Happy Birthday to Us". It was a nice way to end the
evening!

Then, back to the hotel to rest up for the trip home on Sunday.

Texas is Closed
***************

Cheryl left Norfolk and headed for K.C. to house sit and work on our house
there for a week, and I headed back to classes in Austin.  We said our
goodbyes at the airport, and headed to our separate gates.

My flight from Norfolk went through Houston, and I arrived with no problem.
However, as soon as we landed it started raining pretty hard. That was
annoying, since the plane was a small commuter craft, and the ramp was not
covered. That made us hustle through the rain to the terminal. Then I had a long
walk to the gate for the next flight.

I got to the gate in plenty of time for the flight. And sat there, and sat
there!

It was still raining, but they did load the plane - about 30 minutes late. Again
we sat and sat. To make matters worse, there was no air conditioning on this
plane and we were all baking in the heat. Finally, about a half hour after we
expected to take off, they informed us that the airport was closed due to
lightning in the area. Fine, I thought, I would not like to be in an airplane
as it gets hit by lightning! It does happen, but it is no fun!

We were made to de-plane and go back into the waiting area. We were told the
delay could be several hours! As we sat there we kept hearing about cancelled
flights, and gate changes for other flights. We just sat and waited, hoping we
could get out.

All at once, they asked us to re-board!

Apparently, there was a hole in the storm approaching, and they thought they
could get us out. We managed to get on board, the crew buttoned up the plane,
and we taxied out to join about 15 other planes all trying to do the same
thing. I saw planes headed to Germany, France, Alaska, and Austin, all lined up
waiting for their turn at the runway. 

Rush Hour at an airplane!

We managed to get airborne, and had to sit through a fairly bumpy ride to
Austin, all of 26 minutes long! (It takes us 3 hours!) When we touched down in
Austin, I saw maybe 15-20 airplanes lined up on each of two different runways.
They were all trying to get out of Austin. It seems that not only was Houston
closed for the storms, but Dallas was as well. That pretty much zapped air
travel all along the south part of the U.S!

As I walked through the terminal, the airport was jammed with travelers all
trying to get home. There ware tons of flights delayed because of that storm.
What a mess.

Back Home
*********

I retrieved my truck, and made it home in time to take care of our cat's evening
meal and shots. It was a relief to get home.

We had a very hectic, stressful, and even fun, set of days through all of this.
We were very stressed in Houston until we got the good news there, then the
stress of the trip, then the stress of navigating around a place we have never
visited. But the time spent with old and new friends helped make the last part a
nice time, and in the end, we did enjoy this adventure.

I was very happy to find out that my blog has helped several of my classmates
deal with their medical adventures. That was a part of why I decided to write
this thing. I want folks to know that even something as scary as cancer is
something you can survive. But not without the help and care from a ton of
other folks. Sure, you depend on the medical folks. But in my case, without
Cheryl by my side through all of this, and the HUGE crowd of folks who pray for
both of us as we travel through this painful adventure, I would not be here to
tell the tale. Thank God for all of you!

To the George Mason Class of 64, all of you who joined together in Virginia Beach this
weekend, and all of you who could not be there, thanks for creating a group of
travelers through life who care for each other and make this journey so
worthwhile. As we get older, we all work through issues, but all in all, I
think we are a great bunch.

A special thanks to Phil and Debbie for hosting this event. You done us proud!

Go Mustangs!
