I wore my U.S. Air Force (retired) shirt today, and had several folks around
school thank me for my service. That has not happened before, and it was kind
of nice to hear.

But my service is nothing compared to that of those who came well before me. My
own second dad, Andy Tarapchak, survived 70+ missions in a B-26 bomber over
France and Germany during WWII. I have watched a few shows on the History
Channel lately, showing what those young men (early 20′s for most of them) went
through to keep the world free. The 8th Air Force alone lost 26,000 men out of
over 130,000 who flew with that unit during that war.

Thank those folks if you get a chance. There are not that many of them left,
but what we owe that generation is beyond words! I had a chance to hear from a
number of them in person during the dedication of the World War II Memorial on
the Mall in D.C.

Once, while stationed in Omaha, Nebraska, I attended a dinner at the Officer’s
Chub with over a dozen Medal of Honor recipients in attendance. All were
wearing their medals! You cannot stand in front of a man wearing that medal and
not be awe-struck! None of these folks ever thought of themselves as anything
other than ordinary soldiers. But, in one extraordinary moment in time their
inner strength drove then to do something none of them knew they had it in
themselves to do. Amazing people, each and every one!

Read this citation for one Medal of Honor recipient, and wonder how these fine
young people managed to do all this (Found on the Internet):

    B-17 Pilot 1st Lt.Gott Medal of Honor Citation

    1st Lt.Gott, Donald, J. – (Air Mission) Lt., US Army Air Corps. 729th.
    Bomber Squadron, 452d Bombardment Group. Action: Saarbrucken, Germany, 9 Nov
    1944. Inducted: Arnett, Okla. 11083 Sun 1923. Arnett. Okla. G.O. #38. 16 May
    1945. Citation: On a bombing run upon the marshaling yards at Saarbrucken a
    B-17 aircraft piloted by 1st. Lt. Gott was seriously damaged by antiaircraft
    fire. Three of the aircrafts engines were damaged beyond control and on fire;
    dangerous flames from the No.4 engine were leaping back as far as the tail
    assembly. Flares in the cockpit were ignited and a fire raged therein, which
    was further increased by free-flowing fluid from damaged hydraulic lines. The
    interphone system was rendered useless. In addition to these serious mechanical
    difficulties the engineer was wounded in the leg and the radio operators arm
    was severed below the elbow. Suffering from intense pain, despite the
    applicaton of a tourniquet, the radio operator fell unconscious. Faced with the
    imminent explosion of his aircraft, and death to his entire crew, mere seconds
    before bombs away on the target 1st Lt.Gott and his copilot conferred.
    Something had to be done immediately to save the life of the wounded radio
    operator. The lack of a static line and the thought that his unconscious body
    striking the ground in unknown territory would not bring immediate medical
    attention forced a quick decision. 1st Lt.Gott and his copilot decided to fly
    the flaming aircraft to friendly territory and then attempt to crash land.
    Bombs were released on the target and (be crippled aircraft proceeded alone to
    Allied-controlled territory. When that had been reached, 1st. Lt.Gott had the
    copilot personally inform all crewmembers to bail out. The copilot chose to
    remain with 1st Lt.Gott in order to assist in landing the bomber. With only one
    normally functioning engine, and with the danger of explosion much greater, the
    aircraft banked into an open field, and when it was at an altitude of 100 feet
    it exploded crashed, exploded again and then disintegrated. All 3 crewmembers
    were instantly killed 1st. Lt. Gott’s loyalty to his crew, his determination to
    accomplish the task set forth to him, and his deed of knowingly performing what
    may have been his last service to his country was an example of Valor at its
    highest.

Respectfully,

Roie R. Black Major, USAF (Retired)
