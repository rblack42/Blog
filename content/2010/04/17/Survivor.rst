Surviving Cancer

If you have read any of my past ramblings, you probably saw that I got to
explore the wonderful world of medical treatments for the "Big C"! It was quite
an experience, one I do not wish on anyone.  The good news is that so far
everything worked! I have been cancer-free for over two years now, but I still
need to have tests done every three months or so.  The next one is at the end
of this term, something that makes one nervous until you get the results.

The moral to my story is to trust yourself to the care of God, your doctors,
and your family and friends and let things go as much as you can. Sure things
like this are scary, but dwelling on the problem and wishing it away will not
help a bit. I hope I kept a positive mind set through my experience and did
well. Thanks to all 13 doctors, the 150 or so friends who send email to me
throughout the process, and especially thanks to my wife, Cheryl, whose love
and support got us both through the process.

Since I obviously survived the ordeal, I have decided to add the cancer blog
here so others can read it.  If you are suffering through cancer, or have
someone you care about who is going through it, perhaps this will help. Many
who read the original blog during my treatment commented that they found it
helpful as well.
