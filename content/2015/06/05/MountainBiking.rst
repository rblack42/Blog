Since my cancer adventure started I have had two surgeries requiring skin grafts
to cover the damage they were doing to my face. I never realized my legs were
actually tissue farms for just this kind of situation. Anyway, I now have two
long scars on my legs (one on each side) where they have "borrowed" tissue to
graft to my face. (Part of one leg now lives in my mouth. Weird that it is
still hairy!)

They did not take muscle, but my legs are not as strong as they were before all
this. I was running almost 13 miles a day when I got hit by the cancer train.
That is a half-marathon every day! Wow!

I have always found running more satisfying then any other form of exercise,
but I am considering returning to biking, just in case I cannot run the way I
want to anymore. And that got me remembering my adventures on a mountain bike!

What is a Mountain Bike
***********************

Lots of people ride mountain bikes, but few of them have ever ridden one on an
actual mountain! I have. For that matter, I bet most four-wheel drive vehicles
have never left the pavement!

A mountain bike is a more durable bike than those racing bikes (which have
probably never raced either) you see on the street. They have beefier frames,
fatter tires, and often have shock systems to absorb the bumps they will take
when you go airborne (yikes) or slam them into stuff in your way!

I bought my first mountain bike while I lived in Dayton Ohio in the 1970s.
Actually, it was my second real bike (not counting the couple I had as a kid).
My first was a street bike with really skinny tires. On one of my first rides
on that one, I was riding along a residential road when the wide curb lane for
bikes or parked cars came to an end. I had to move into the main road to
continue on my way. So I glanced behind me to make sure there was no traffic,
and rode right onto a rain grate covering where water flowing down the gutter
went into the sewer system. No big deal, right? Wrong! The tires on my bike
were so skinny they fit between the rails on the rain grate which was aligned
in the direction I was riding. (Boy is that a law suit waiting to happen!) My
tires slipped between the rails, the bike fell down about a foot, and came to a
screeching halt. I flew over the handle bars and tumbled into the grass beyond
the grate. The wheel looked like a pretzel when I managed to pull the mess out
of the grate! It looked something like this:

Maybe I should have sued, but I was fine. My bike should have sued, though. It
was a wreck! I had to buy a new wheel, tire and all. In the end, I traded it in
for one better suited for riding in my neighborhood. That was my mountain bike.

First Rides
***********

I put a lot of miles on that bike while living in Dayton. Most of them on paved
streets. I worked up to rides over 100 miles long. My rear end was very sore as
I learned to do that. The seats on these things were not really designed for
human beings. After a while you do get used to things, but it took a while.

I never felt like I was really getting any exercise, though. I would ride,
sometimes in a group, and after 40 or 50 miles, I would get off any not even
feel like I had worked up a sweat! When I ran, I was soaked in sweat, since I
was running reasonable well back then. The Air Force expected you to stay in
shape, and tested you every year to make sure you could run at least a mile and
a half at a pretty quick pace. I ran way more than that, usually at least 10k
on any run I did. 

One day, I climbed off of my bike after a 50 mile run with a group of riders in
my neighborhood, and decided I needed more exercise. So, I put the bike in the
garage, buttoned up my house, and started off running.

Big mistake!

If you ride a bike at any kind of speed, those muscles in your legs ARE
working, even if you do not feel like they are. I got two blocks, and my legs
felt like Jello. I could hardly stand up. So, I gave up on the run and weakly
limped back to the house. I guess you do get exercise when riding the bike
after all!

Riding in Nebraska
******************

When I moved to Nebraska, I ended up getting into Arabian Horses, and the bike
stayed in the garage! I did all my riding on my horse! It was fun, but I got no
exercise that way. I went back to running, and running a lot! 

The base gym started a program for runners where you logged your miles, and
every 500 miles they would give you a tee-shirt so you could brag about your
mileage. A few of my friends and I decided to train for the marathon in Lincoln,
Nebraska, so we signed up for the program and started piling on the miles. I was
averaging about 10 miles per day during the week, and ran about 15 miles on the
week end. We burned through 500 miles so fast, the gym had trouble printing up
the tee shirts for us. In the end, I ran 2500 miles between Jan 1 and the end
of August. I ran my first half-marathon (at Lincoln that year, and that is the
only time I have set foot in Husker Stadium! That shrine to University of
Nebraska football is one of the biggest "cities" in Nebraska on game days. They
have sold that thing out every game since the late 1960s!)

My goal that first race was to finish the half-marathon in time to see the
winners complete the full marathon, and I did. I managed to get under the
finish line clock in 2:00:10! I saw that time coming up as I ran around the
track that surrounds the football field, but could not beat the clock to two
hours!  Durn!

The next year, I did better, and managed to complete the half marathon in 1:35.
But when I worked my way up in miles for a full marathon, things happened. I
was running over 21 miles on weekends, and was ready for the marathon, when I got
transferred to New Mexico. I missed the Lincoln Marathon, and got to Albuquerque
right after they ran their marathon. So, I never ran one! I did run about six
half marathons during this time, though!

Riding in New Mexico
********************

Ah, Albuquerque! There are REAL mountains there. Mountain bikes are everywhere,
even in the mountains! Now there is an idea. And, all around the city is this
thing called a desert!

I lived on the west side of the river, in an area next to something they called an
escarpment. That was the edge of a kind of cliff formed by flowing lava from
long extinct volcanoes in the area. The cliff face was all lava, and ancient
Indians carved all kinds of images, called petroglyphs, into the rock. It was
an interesting area, and site of a National Monument if you get to the area.

Beyond the cliff was pure desert, and miles of trails for runners, hikers,
people on horseback, and mountain bikers!

The ground was rough, so I had the front fork on my bike replaced with one with
a shock in it, and that made riding on real dirt much easier! I would come home
from work, and jump on the bike for a 40 mile ride. I would ride from my house to the
escarpment, up a road to the top of the cliff, then ride over trails to a set
of extinct volcanoes at the top of a mesa.

From there you could see the entire valley, Albuquerque to Santa Fe, and Los
Alamos! Quite a view.

Zap!
****

Many of my rides ended up at the three volcanoes, which was probably one of my
favorite rides, just because the views were spectacular!

To get there, I rode up the cliff by the park, then down a paved road to a
model airplane flying field, and then into the dirt trails that went to the
volcanoes. About a half mile into that trail it went under a high tension power
line that brought power into the valley, from where I never found out! The lines
were at the top of huge towers, but something weird went on as you got close to
them. 

..  image:: images/PowerLines.png
    :width: 500

    :alt: power lines

Electricity is very interesting stuff. When it moves through a wire, it
generates an electromagnetic field that moves away from the wire at the speed of
light. You know about those waves, they are what we know as radio signals. The
really interesting part is what happens when those waves hit another wire, like
an antenna. They generate a current in the second wire, even though there is no
connection between them. That is how radio works. The current in the second
wire, which we call an antenna, is very weak, and a radio has to amplify that
current to pull out the signal being transmitted by a radio station. Neat!

But these power lines were not generating music, they were just sending huge
amounts of power to Albuquerque! They did generate a "radio" signal, though,
that pounced on my bike, which was made of metal. The bike got charged up with
a small current moving through it. I never felt that, though!

Now, my bike had a 21-speed transmission on it, something I really liked for
reasons we will talk about later. There was a seven speed hub on the rear
wheel, and a three speed setup on the crank you turned with your feet. The
mechanism that let you change speeds was manipulated by steel wire cables
running from the handlebars to each mechanism. There was a lever near the front
crank where the front cable was connected.

That cable was bolted to the lever, then ran about two inches beyond the lever,
where it ended. The manufacturer of the bike had put a plastic cap on the end
of the wire so you would not poke yourself if you reached your hand down there.
That was nice. However, the wire was there and you leg moved close to it as you
pedaled the silly bike. My leg passed within an inch of the end of the wire,
and I never noticed it. Until I rode under those line, that is.

That current moving through the bike, moved into that wire, and when I was
directly under the tower and my leg was close, there was a spark between the
end of that wire and my sweaty leg. I saw it one time, and felt it several
times. The first time it happened, I almost jumped off the bike! Then I
figured out what was going on, and bent the wire so it moved further from my
leg! Glad my curiosity taught me all about that. Otherwise, I would have been
looking for evil ghosts with ray guns!

It turns out that if you take a fluorescent light tube with you and walk under
power lines like these, the bulb will light up! That is something strange to
see!

I was still running, riding my bike, and riding my horse all over this area.
It was an amazing place for exploring!

Retirement
**********

When it was time to retire from the Air Force, my mother was in the middle of a
very serious surgery, and I elected to pack up all my belongings, and move back
to D.C. to help her through all that. I shipped my bike, enough clothes for an
extended stay, and rode a train across the country back to live in her
apartment while she recovered.

That was a hard, but interesting time. In the end, my mom died from the
surgery, and my time was spent working on dealing with her apartment, and
working with my sisters to get through all the pain of this loss. That is
another story.

I rode the bike all over the area. I grew up here, and knew the area well. So,
I jumped on that bike and rode everywhere. I was living in Annandale, about 10
miles from D. C., and about five miles from my home town of Falls Church. I
rode back home and explored my town, I rode to Mount Vernon and explored
George's old home, I rode along the Potomac River, and up the Mall and the
museums I had spent so much time is as a kid. I had a blast.

I even rode what used to be an old railroad line, but is now a bike path called
the B&O Bike Trail, that runs over 70 miles from the Blue Ridge mountains west
of D. C. all the way to the Potomac River near Alexandria. I explored the
battlefields near Manassas. I went everywhere.

Then all my work there was done. I bought a car, packed up my stuff, including
my bike, and headed back to Albuquerque. I had to restart my life after 20
years in the Air Force.

Job Shopping
************

When I got back to Albuquerque, I rented a small apartment and started up the
resume mill. Every morning, I would scour the want ads for jobs in the area,
and even went to the local book store and looked over newspapers with ads from
surrounding areas. I sent resumes out in Albuquerque, in Santa Fe, in Los
Alamos. I looked at jobs in Socorro, in Flagstaff, in Phoenix! Everywhere an
old computer geek might find employment.

In the end I landed a job with the city of Omaha, working in their IT
department. And that is yet another story. Back to biking, though!

Riding on Kirtland AFB
======================

My work day went like this: In the mornings, I was shopping for jobs. I would
print up a job application, write a cover letter, tune up a custom resume for
that particular job, and ship it off in the mail. When I ran out of prospects,
I was done for the day. I would jump on the bike and ride. This time, I
was living near the base so many of my rides were onto the base, which is huge.
At the far back part of the base there are a bunch of labs where specialized
experiments are conducted. There are miles of roads around there, with all
kinds of interesting things going on. Fortunately, as a retired Air Force
Officer, I had permission to wander all over that place.

Public Trails
=============

The local bike shops all had maps showing public trails in the mountains, so I
started riding those as well. I would stick my bike on a rack on the trunk, and
head out to the start of a marked trail and ride the trail. There were over 200
miles of marked trails on one of those maps, and I used a highlighter to mark
the ones I rode. Eventually, I rode most of them! That was fun, but a bit
dangerous.

I was riding alone most of the time, although there were usually others on the
trails as well. However some of the trails were seldom visited, unless you were
on a quest to ride them all, like I seemed to be doing.

I once rounded a curve in the trial, out in the middle of nowhere, and ran
smack into an old (20 years or so) police car. I have absolutely no idea how it
got there. I finally decided some helicopter dropped it there just to confuse
poor saps like me! I looked it over for  bit, then rode on. Weird.

The problem was that if I ever fell off and broke something (like myself). I
might be stranded there until someone rode by. You could not use a cell phone
then, they were too new, and the signal did not reach into the mountains
anyway.  I did have my amateur radio with me, which worked extremely well in
the desert, but in the mountains I had the same problem, no signal!

I would have been bleached bones by the time I was found, if anything really
bad happened. Fortunately, I was immortal back then, and never had a problem.
But what if?

The Big Hill
============

One of my rides was a killer. I would ride along the river from my apartment to
the far north part of town, near a private airport. I usually looked over the
planes there, then steeled myself for the next part of the ride. 

Tramway Road runs from the Interstate in the middle of the valley straight
towards Sandia Mountain. The climb is over six miles long, and all uphill at a
pretty steep angle. This is a good test of your cooling system if you drive it
in your car. It is also a good test of your human cooling system if you ride it
on a bike as well!

It is also a first gear hill. I would switch to first gear, and
pedal furiously to the top of the hill. On a hot day, and there were many, I
probably lost five pounds just in sweat!. It was a real sense of accomplishment
when you reached the top. 

By the way. Just behind that first set of hills on the left side of this
picture is the base of La Luz Trail, which climbs to the top of the mountain,
over nine miles of hiking. Before I retired, I ran the La Luz Run. We "ran" all
the way to the top, then hiked a mile and got a free ride on the tram back to
the bottom. Another mile of hiking got us back to our cars. What I was
doing at the top could hardly be called running, more like shuffling along in a
vain attempt to keep moving, but I made it. We climbed over 4000 feet straight
up on that run!

My goal, in riding up Tramway, was always the turn off that took you to the
tram. From that point you had a clear view of the entire valley and the city
below. If you rode the tram to the top of the mountain, the view was even better!

..  image:: images/SandiaTram.png

    :alt: Sandia Tram


After I recovered from the climb, I would ride along the base of the mountain,
another 10 miles back to the base. It was great exercise!

On occasions I would get caught in the rain on one of these long rides. Rain in
Albuquerque is strange. It hardly ever rains over the whole city. Instead it
rains "somewhere", and you have to ask what block the rain is falling on. I
could stand next to the mountain, survey the valley, and decide on a route home
that avoided the showers on my route. That was fun! And if that did not work,
Who cares? I was already wet from sweat, maybe that would keep me from needing a
shower when I finally got back home (NOT!)

Mountain Riding
***************

The best times I ever had were riding in the mountains. That is what mountain
bikes were built for.

There is a ski area on the East side of Sandia Mountain, which towers over
Albuquerque. At the top, it is over 10,000 feet above sea level. At the base,
around 6000 feet. The city is about 5000 feet. During the summer, they run the
ski lifts up to the top of the mountain, and you can rent mountain bikes to
ride down the trails that line the actual ski runs. That is what many folks do,
and the rides are very nice. Lots of mountain scenery to see, and not much
work, since it is all downhill!

Me, on the other hand, did it differently.

I would drive to the ski area with my bike, and park there. The elevation was
around 7000 feet. High enough to make exercising a problem. Then I would get
on my bike and ride up the road to the top of the mountain. That was another first
gear ride and it took over an hour to get to the top. By the time you did that
a number of times, the altitude ceased to be a problem. Then, I would ride about
a mile along the ridge at the top of the mountain to the ski lodges and
restaurants there. That is where the tram from Albuquerque also stops, carrying
skiers and tourists from the city. 

From that point, I would ride down the trails back to my car. All in all, about
four hours of riding. And I did those rides often.

On one of my rides to the top of the mountain, I ran into a hang-glider
contest, where over a hundred pilots were competing. They would strap
themselves into their gliders, then run to the edge of the cliff and jump into
the air. That cliff had a 4000 foot drop straight to the bottom of the
mountain. It also had a huge updraft caused by wind hitting the mountain and
going straight up into the sky. Those updrafts could keep a glider up for hours.
Eventually, they would land in a clearing right back at the top of the
mountain!

I was thinking about lemmings rushing into the ocean when I saw about a dozen
of these folks all standing in a line, then running one after another to jump
off that cliff! I never had the nerve to try that!

Bear Country
============

On another one of my rides, I was riding down one of the trails back to the
car.  I was snaking my way through the forest, making sure I did not run into
any trees, when I popped out into a clearing. The trail went through a  field
of tall grass, then reentered the forest. I was moving fast! All at once, I
spotted something standing on the side of the trail!

..  image:: images/BlackBear.png
    :width: 500
    :align: center
    :alt: Black Bear

He was just standing there, with his nose right in the middle. I
was moving so fast, there was no way to stop, and I did not want to stop
anyway! Instead, I moved to the side of the trail, and sailed right by him! He
was probably as surprised by this as I was. If I had reached out my hand, I
would have smacked him on the nose, we were that close. 

I was by him and back in the trees before I really realized what had just
happened! I stopped a bit further down, and looked back to see him staring at
me, but not moving! I bet he wrote about that day in his blog as well! Weird
humans!

I may buy another bike, and do some riding to help build myself back up after
my cancer ordeal. It might be another mountain bike, but I may go back to those
skinny tired beasts. I will remember to look out for rain grates, though! (They
are much safer these days, I bet more than a few idiots like me did sue!)
