Don't get me wrong! It is not life, itself, that is senseless. I want to talk
about living a life without senses! That is actually hard to do. 

You all know the five senses we all are born with. (OK, most of us are anyway!)

    * Sight - ophthamoception
    
    * Sound - audioception
    
    * Touch - tactioception
    
    * Taste - gustaception
    
    * Smell - olfaception

Wow, I was not ready for those technical terms. Wikipedia turns up interesting
stuff at times!

We take all of these senses for granted most days of our lives. That is unless
you experience something that heightens your awareness of those senses.

Experiencing your Senses
************************

Think about it, when was the last time one of your senses became the focus of
your life, if even for a moment.

Touch
=====

I banged my foot into a chair last night, after turning out the lights in the
living room and walking to bed. My foot became the center of the universe until
the pain subsided! I did not care about much of anything else until then!

Last week, my seeing sense was lit up when I say my doctor grab a knife and
come at me to perform a minor surgery. I was not quite ready for that. I bet my
eye (the only one I currently have) got big at that sight!

Today, in class, I heard an explosion of noise in the hall. Two girls were
walking by my classroom where the door was open, and "exploded into laughter,
just as they passed my class. IT disrupted the whole thing. Part of me wanted
to slap them for being so inconsiderate of what was going on in that building,
but I doubt it would have made any difference these days!

Losing Your Senses
******************

Now comes the hard part. I have been losing my senses in various ways over
these last eight years, and sometimes that loss is hard to deal with.

Hearing Loss
============

Before all of my cancer adventure started, I was aware that my hearing was
fading a bit. I had an ear infection when I was stationed at SAC headquarters
in Omaha back around 1985, and ended up with Tinnitus (ringing in the ear). I
had to learn how to deal with a constant, fairly loud, high pitched pair of
tones in my left ear, that never goes away. For the first six months I had to deal
with this, it was hard to sleep. Gradually, it stopped being something I paid
much attention to, and life went on. Still, it is always there!

I measure my hearing by the volume number on the TV I rarely watch, but which
is usually on when  am working with my laptop on the couch. I noticed that the
number was creeping up a bit, and that told me I was losing some of my hearing.

Then came cancer and a ton of radiation into my upper jawbone, right next to my
ear. I did not notice much of a change, but the radiation affected the entire
area around my ear. My ENT was watching out for all of that, but I could tell
he was worried about things.

MY second cancer surgery was again in the same area, but closer to my left ear this time.
Nothing much happened to my hearing then, but things were very different on my
third surgery. That time, as my new surgeon at M.D. Anderson put it, they "eradicated the
eustachian tube" which runs from behind your ear drum down into your sinus
region. That tube normally lets pressure inside your ear equalize with the air
outside your head. (Those of you who are not pilots never think much about
pressure differences, but they happen all the time, and can affect you in may
strange ways. You know this, you have had your ears "pop" when the pressure
changes, then releases as air makes its way back up that tube.

Only mine was shot. So fluid started filling up the area behind my ear drum,
which effectively shut down my hearing completely on that side. Not good!

I discovered I could not make out folks speaking near to me, the number on my
TV went way up. Add to that the problem that I could not tell where sound was
coming from at all. With only one er working, I had no directional sense as far
as sounds were concerned. It was no fun trying to listen to much of anything!

Time for Hearing Aides
----------------------

I ended up buying a very expensive set of hearing aides, only to find out that
the left one did absolutely nothing. Even cranked all the way up, I heard
nothing. I did have improvement on my right side, which was really only fading
from age related issues, not cancer issues. So I did get some improvement with
the hearing aide.

I discovered that the mechanics on my left side were fine when I bought a pair
of headphones with volume controls on both sides. By cranking the volume all
the way up on the left side, and all the way down on the right (one notch above
off completely), I was able to hear almost normally. Unfortunately, what I was
hearing on the left side was due to "bone conduction". I was not hearing due to
the ear drum vibrating. The sound was vibrating the bones in my head, and my
ear was picking that up. 

After Dr. Scholl poked a hole in my ear drum and put a plastic tube through it,
some of that fluid did drain out, and my ear drum started working again. I do have
a problem with draining fluid clogging up the hearing aide ear piece, so I have
to clean it out often, but at least now I can hear out of both ears, and now my
sense of where sounds come from is back.

I did not realize how much I used that sense, until I lost it!

Sight Loss
==========

Seeing is another issue. Of course, I did lose my left eye to cancer 18 months ago,
so my seeing is definitely affected. You actually only lose about 20 degrees in
your total field of vision when you lose an eye. That is not as bad as you
might think. However, I constantly feel there is something big over on that left
side, blocking my sight over there. Weird! I do not actually see the big thing,
I just feel like it is there. 

When it first happened, I felt like I was living in a valley with a big
mountain on one side. I was worried that when I took my "Big Sky" vacation in
Montana this summer, I would not see the big sky. It turned out just fine! The sky
was big enough to make an impression on me, even with only one eye.

What I miss the most about losing that eye is depth perception. With only one
eye, doing precise things close up is hard. Tonight, I was trying to stick a
tiny plastic wire into the tube that runs between the ear piece of my
hearing aide that I stick into my ear canal, and the electronics body that hangs
behind my er. The wire cleans out any debris that stops sound from reaching the
amplifier. Getting the end of that wire into that tube was very hard to do,
because I could not "see" where the end was!

Actually, depth perceptions is only really active out to about 20 feet. Driving
is no problem, but maneuvering close to other things is hard. I am constantly
worried that I am going to run into a pole in the parking garage as I drive
around. And driving into an ATM machine is very scary. Sometimes, when I think I am
so close to something, I will stop my truck and get out for a look. Most of the
time I am a couple feet further from the thing than I think I am. Some day I
will misjudge and bang into something, but so far so good.

Touch Loss
==========

Then there is touch.

The surgeries have basically severed the nerves on the left side of my face as
far as feeling goes. I cannot feel much of anything from below the eye (or
where it used to be) and my lower chin on the left side of my face. The dead
zone runs from my nose to my ear. Dr. Scholl was worried I would not be able to
close my eyelid on that side after surgery two, but that part was fine. After
surgery three, the entire eye went away, and there is no eyelid to close
anymore. They sealed the entire area with skin from my leg! 

I tell folks, "I am winking at you, can't you tell?" (Usually girls, of
course!).

I have no feeling in the left side of my mouth either, so eating is a
challenge. I lost most of my upper jawbone on that side and all those upper
teeth, so chewing on that side is out of the question. The worst part of all of
this is that since I have no feeling there, getting burned on something hot is
easy to do, so I have to be careful.

Even brushing my remaining teeth is tough. I have absolutely no idea where i am
brushing on that side. I am going to have to see the dentist more often to help
with cleaning.

On the plus side, having dental work done on that side is no problem at all. My
dentist does not even need to give me Novocain!


Taste Loss
==========

Most of your taste comes through your tongue. The nerve damage in my mouth
extends into half of my tongue as well, so I do not taste things the way I used
to. Add to that all the radiation I had, and the left side of my mouth is a
mess. There are no saliva glands working over there, so that side stays pretty
dry. I have to keep something to drink handy, especially when I teach, so my
mouth does not dry out completely.

The strangest thing about all that is that my taste has changed. I used to
drink a lot of Diet Coke. Now, drinking that stuff tastes like drinking pepper!
I simply cannot do it. Instead , I have switched to A&W Cream Soda, something I
was introduced to by my grandfather when I was a kid. I can drink that just
fine, but Cheryl is not happy with that, since it is full of sugar, and my
cancer feeds on sugar! I am trying to wean myself off of that and move to
flavored water. I do know that the fizz in the drinks helps me swallow (that is
not a sense, but pretty important). My swallowing is bad now, again due to all
the radiation. I have to drink "thick" fluids to help wash things down!)

Smelling Loss
=============

Hey, I just realized something! I still smell fine. Well, I can smell fine, I
am never sure that I physically smell fine. Then again, with all the radiation I have had, I
might light up in the dark, so maybe if I do not smell fine, no one will
notice!  They will be so fascinated by my "glow"!

Living this Senseless Life
**************************

Sure I have a bunch of physical problems to deal with. But I do not dwell on
those. I am telling this story because others reading this blog have loved ones
(or themselves) to help through what life is throwing their way. We are
all challenged by these kinds of problems, to be sure. My take on all of this is
that that how you deal with all of this says a lot about the kind of person you
really are. I do not want any one to say I caved in to any of this. I am
fighting it and will keep doing so as long as I can!

All in all, I am a mess! But a living, breathing, blogging mess.

I intend to stay that way (the living part, that is! Maybe I can improve the mess part!)

Sigh!
