Cancer Wrapup - I think I made it!

It has been over two years since my treatments ended. Cancer survivors work on
reaching the five-year mark as a real measure of success. Originally, my
doctor gave me a 75% chance of getting through all this - not a number I was
happy to hear. After two years, that number is up to 90% - much better, but
not good enough yet. I have PET/CAT scans about every year now to make sure
nothing new has shown up, and all is fine up to now.

No matter what, I owe a great deal to my support team, both family and
friends, who helped get me through all this. Today, it is hard to think back
to all the adventures I wrote about here. I still re-read this every now and
again to remind myself how lucky I really am. My wife and I have too many
friends and family members who did not fare so well.

May you never have to experience any of this!
