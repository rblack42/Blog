This blog is primarily for my students at Austin Community College.
However, I find myself talking about my life experiences a lot, so it may be
interesting to others as well. I have been blessed in my life, and I have had
amazing adventures that I want to share with others. I am not trying to brag
about my life. I never set out to be anything more than a person who lived his
life the best way he could. Sure, I made mistakes in my life that I wish I could
take back. But in looking back, I was very blessed. I met a bunch of
interesting people - some of whom are famous in their own right! I just
happened to have succeeded in living a life of wonder and amazement. I want
nothing less than for others, especially my family, friends, and especially my
students to have the same kind of life. Enjoy my ramblings. I enjoyed living
them!
