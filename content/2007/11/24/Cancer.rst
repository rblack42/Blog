Today, my oral surgeon called me with the news that problems I have been
having with my teeth is due to cancer in my jawbone. The shock of that phone
call is something you will never forget, but I remember thinking that if this
was true, all I could do is work with the medical team I was sure to meet and
do the best I could to survive it. If it all works, fine, if not - well, I
have lived a pretty good life, and we all go sometime, maybe this is my time.

My wife, Cheryl, who went through cancer many years ago, simple told me I was
going to be fine. How she knew this, I will never know - but her positive
attitude helped get me started on the path we would take.

I did not start this blog until I was part the surgery, which was actually
something of a non-event, and ready to go through the real treatments. I added
this material just to complete the story.
