Well, my mood these days is off a bit, with good reason. I had that PET scan on
Wednesday of last week and have heard nothing from anyone on what is going on.
That seems odd, since my doctors normally are on top of the situation and let
me know as soon as they can. Living through the last four days has been an
exercise in keeping my mind off of the far too natural tendency to go off to
the extremes of the situation. I feel I cannot ignore those extremes, but
dwelling on them is as big a mistake. I need to be ready for whatever I hear,
whenever I hear it. I have an appointment with my surgeon on Tuesday, but I hope
someone calls before that.

Yesterday, Cheryl and I took off on a mini-road trip down to Bourne Stage
Airfield, here I flew a glider a few years ago. We managed to get there as my
instructor landed in a neat motor-glider he was about to go get back when I
last flew with him. Cheryl kept telling me I should get one of those, but,
alas, all the necessary money for such a thing is tied up in our Kansas City
house. Anyway, flying is something I can do later (I hope).

It was a fun excursion, and a good way for both of us to get our minds off this
situation. Waiting is always a pain!
