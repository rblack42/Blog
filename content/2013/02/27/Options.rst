Today is about options. I am relatively certain I know the option I will take,
but I need to explore everything, to hear what a select subset of my medical
team thinks about the situation.  I have appointments next week with my
Oncologist and my Radiologist, both of whom were happy to see me reach five
years, and unhappy with the current turn of events. Welcome to the club!

My surgeon even told me I could go for a second opinion, and recommended
M.D. Anderson in Houston, one of the top cancer hospitals in the country. He
trained there, and I trust his opinion, but Cheryl and I are discussing all of
this. 

At a meeting of our church Board of Director's this morning (Cheryl is on that
board), she was reduced to tears as the entire board surrounded her and prayed.
That kind of support is powerful, for both of us.

I am working on a few projects today, things that keep me from dwelling on the
current situation. 

Here is a quote that just went by on television:

    "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards"
    
        Soren Kierkegaard
