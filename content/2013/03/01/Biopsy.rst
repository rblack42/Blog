When we visited the surgeon on Tuesday, he took three tissue samples from the
area in my mouth where the original cancer was found. Today he called back with
the lab results. Yes, I have another round of cancer treatments to go through.
This time, the surgery will be hard, since the area affected in in my cheek
bone. I will lose that bone, and skin around the area. The team of doctors will
expand to include plastic surgeons who will borrow skin from somewhere and
rebuild that area. What it all ends up looking like is anyone's guess for now.
But the only other options leave me with only a year or two, and Cheryl and I
are not ready for that yet!

Hmmm, Austin has a bunch of film folks around, perhaps the special effects
folks can come up with something for me to wear if it looks too bad! 

We are trying to figure out when this can all happen. I am smack in the middle
of a semester at school, and having the surgery during this term will make a
mess of all that, but the doctors do not want the cancer to spread, so that
will take priority, no matter what.

So we have started on another round of doctor's visits to see what we can put
together. So far, my primary care doctor says I am healthy, with the lungs of a
45 year old! Thank running for that! He suggested that I work on getting back in
shape, so the ordeal will go better. It is hard to get charged up for that, but
I will end up doing it. Running helps clear my mind.
