Searching for Excellence

Long ago, I read an interesting book by Tom Peters titled "In Search of
Excellence". That book told stories about several companies that set out to do
the best job they could do in their business areas. I used that book as
inspiration when I moved into management in my Air Force career, especially
when I ran the Phillips Laboratory Supercomputer Center at Kirtland AFB, in
Albuquerque, NM. Even though that facility was a military one, we had to run it
like a business, earning research dollars from scientists all over the country
who needed supercomputer time to do their research.

Seeking excellence in what we all did every day was how we managed to make our
scientists happy with the support we provided them.

Where is the drive for excellence?
**********************************

Today, I read an article that disturbed me. The article told of a congressional
inquiry into an Air Force incident in which 17 officers were relieved of duty
as launch officers in our nuclear fleet of missiles. The reasons given were
that they were new to the service and had not yet learned how important this
job was. The officers involved could not do their jobs correctly during an
inspection. The commander of the unit where these officers were assigned did
the right thing, he relieved them of duty until they could prove that they were
ready for the job. What went through my mind was why those officers were not
driven, themselves, to do the best job possible. Failing to do that job
correctly could have huge consequences. Clearly, something was wrong, and that
is why the inquiry was going on.

When I was assigned to Strategic Air Command Headquarters in Omaha, NE, I
supervised a group  of engineers who produced the programs we loaded into those
nuclear missiles to control them as they flew their missions. I used to lie in
bed at night amazed that I had been given that responsibility. If we screwed
up, and our missiles were launched, we might not win the war. We all prayed
that our programs never actually got tested for real, and, thank God, they
never were!  But the defense of the United States of America depended in large
part on the work we did, and we all knew that. We all took that responsibility
very seriously.

Excellence in what we did was not a goal. It was the minimum acceptable
requirement, not something we hoped we could reach. It was something we had to
reach!

It seems that we are facing a problem these days. Young folks do not seem to
have the same drive to be excellent at what they do the way us old folks had.
Probably every generation has said this about the next generation, so it must be
my turn. I know many will disagree with this, and there are plenty of examples
of young professionals doing outstanding jobs. But I see far too many examples
where young folks feel that doing the minimum needed to get by is perfectly
fine with them! Excellence is not something they worry about.

That bothers me a lot!

Students

I teach computer programming courses. In far too many of those classes, I run
into students who will only do exactly what you tell them to do. Why do more,
they ask. Then they expect to get an "A" on their work. Should that be the
reward for minimally acceptable work?

In the article I read, there was a comment from General Welch, Air Force Chief of
Staff that went like this:

    "There was more of an attitude problem than a proficiency problem,” Welsh
    said. ... “They [the commanders] took very aggressive action early
    to make sure that there was no question in the minds of their crew force
    that marginal behavior or sort of satisfactory just above the line was not
    acceptable."

A student who does the minimum "just above the line" work is cheating himself
or herself out of the education they most likely will need to do well in their
careers. I tell students that their job, while in school, is to learn as much
as they can, to become as proficient as they can, to become competitive in the
job market. It is a sad fact of life that jobs are not sitting there waiting
for them when they finish school, they will have to prove themselves better than
the next applicant. If they succeed in getting a job, they then have to keep
that job by being better than the person working next to them. Sadly, this
will come as a shock to quite a few of those folks who are only willing to do
that minimum level of work!

We live in a "copy and paste" world these days. I put up fairly detailed code
examples in my lecture notes, and I see students copy that code and paste it
into an editor. They run the code and it works. Wonderful! They move on to
something else. Did they learn anything doing that? Hardly!

(I sometimes find mistakes in my code. I will hear students complaining about
how bad my notes are in those cases. I have tried telling them those mistakes
are there on purpose, to keep them from doing the "copy and paste" dance. Do
they try to fix the broken code. Some do, but some do not. Sad.)

When I went back to school the last time, to get another Master's degree in
Computer Science, I never copied and pasted any code I found. I forced myself
to type it in using a good programmer's editor. By doing that, I actually read
the program code and thought about what was going on. When I got it running, I
played with it and experimented with my own ideas. In the end I learned
something useful. That, to me, is a much more valuable way to play with an
example program. It seems I can barely convince students to read the notes
sometimes, and only the best students will do more than just what I require them
to do!

Looking for answers
*******************

I am on the prowl for ideas about how to fix this lack of drive for excellence.
Part of the solution has to happen very early in the lives of our children. I
had a ball giving a talk to a bunch of third graders, telling then how I became
a rocket scientist. After that talk, the teachers said those kids were building and
launching rockets in the school yard for weeks. That is exactly the result I
was hoping for.

My classes today involve robots. Not the kind that you see on television
blowing each other up, but the kind you have to work on to make them do
anything! It is hard work, but in the end, it is a lot of fun.

I am working on a web site to support a project I hope to get off the ground
soon. I want to put together a robot lab I can wheel up to a middle school and
let kids play with my robot equipment. Maybe I will try to get a grant to help
do this. Otherwise, an SUV full of robot parts will be wandering around Austin
soon.

In my classes, I am looking for ways to get students to write more code and
actually read the lecture material more. Giving them more work to do also
generates more grading work, so perhaps a system that automates part of this
grading is in order. Hey, that sounds like a project that could be fun!


*************************
What do we do about this?
*************************

This blog is my attempt to tell my story, and I hope that my story helps
inspire and motivate my students to find something that drives them to pursue
excellence. For me, it was a passion for learning how airplanes flew. I know
that seems silly to some folks, but it was the spark that sent me off on a life
adventure of discovery. Wanting to learn how that airplane managed to hang
there in the sky led me to learn about aerodynamics, structures, propulsion
systems, control systems, stability issues, and eventually computers. What
happened to me then was unexpected.

My life long passion for aviation mutated into a passion for understanding how
computers work. That was actually more fun than I expected, and as I got better
and better at working with computers, my career path moved over into computer
science. I am still a huge fan of all things about aviation, but I am an equal
fan of all things about computers.

Why are our young folks not more interested in something that will lead hem into
a fulfilling career? Why are they not more curious about their world. They
have access to far more information today than we had access to in out entire lives.
That is a good thing and a bad ting. I tell my students "You have questions,
Google has answers". That is true, but why are the really interesting questions
missing. Many are too busy making sure all their "friends" on Facebook know
exactly where they are and what they are doing at every waking moment of the
day. Why this is necessary has always been a mystery to me. Do we really need that much
information?

Hopefully my students will find their spark, that one thing that drives them to
be the best they can be at something. All I can do is try to help them do that!

Anyone reading this is welcome to post their ideas on how to inject more drive"
into our students. Use the comment area at the bottom of this post.
