Well, today we visited with my primary surgeon, and he said "You are doing
great!". (Boy I am getting tired of that phrase!) Actually, he was very happy
with my progress and decided to yank out the feeding tube which has been my
primary source of nourishment for the last month. Now, I am stuck! I have to
eat the old fashioned way! He did leave me with a few teeth on my upper jaw,
and I still have all my teeth on the lower jaw, so eating is possible. After
all the treatments are over, I will get a new dental plate to fill in the
missing upper teeth.

My swallowing is much better, but I still have problems with light fluids like
water or soft drinks! Sigh!

Taking out the feeing tube was actually pretty interesting. It seems that when
doctors put in tubes like this for whatever purpose, they usually stitch the tube in
place with sutures to keep it from slipping out. All he had to do was snip the
suture and pull. The tube slid out with no issues at all. All of  sudden, I can
get to my mouth without running into the tube, and I do not have to worry about
someone yanking on the durn thing. I also do not need to drape the tube over my
ear when I try to eat, or stick the end in my pocket after feeding.

I did have one sort of nasty experience with the tube (at least it upset my
wife!). The tube has a shutoff valve on the end of it. You pull the valve out and
plug it back in so you can push fluids through the tube with a big syringe.
When all the fluids are in, you replace the valve so it closes off the tube. At
least, you are supposed to close the tube off.

One evening, I forgot to close the valve after "dinner", and just stuck the end
of the tube in my shirt pocket. A few minutes later I noticed that the front of
my shirt was wet. "Dinner" was working its way back up the tube and soaking
into my shirt. Now this is not as bad as having fully processed dinner come out
of some other place, but Cheryl said that the smell was horrible (I could not
smell it), and it took her quite a while to pre-wash the shirt to get it
wearable again. Such fun!

Testing my ears
***************

My primary surgeon is an Ear-Nose-Throat specialist, and he said the work he
did was very close to my left ear. He was worried that he might damage the
hearing in that ear, so today he did a hearing test and everything came out
fine. Before doing that he vacuumed out my ear canal to get rid of dried blood
and whatever. (Have you seen the ad on television where the guy shoves a Q-Tip
up his ear and yells? That was me today!)

After the test, he pronounced my hearing fine, and we are hoping the radiation
does no further damage in that area.

On to Radiation
***************

The big news for today is that I am well enough to move on to the next big
step: radiation. I am scheduled for 35 treatments (5 days a week for 7 weeks),
just like I did before. Perhaps this time I really will glow in the dark!

Hopefully, these treatments will shrink the "clam" on my cheek so my face will look
more normal.  My doctor's comment today was that it looked like a small boob,
only they forgot to put the nipple on! (Gee, thanks, doc! I needed that!
(Actually, I have used that same analogy more than once, but I like the clam analogy
better!)

We set up an appointment for next week to start getting ready for radiation.
.  They will need to build another "noodle strainer", which is a plastic mesh
they form fit to my head (possible now that the feeding tube i gone). They
clamp this mask over my head to lock me down to the table while they aim the
radiation beam at the area to be treated. Then the doctor will need to map out
a treatment plan using the PET and CT scans they did before surgery. In a visit
to this doctor before surgery, he said that the area we will treat this time is
above the old area from five years ago, and he is confident he can treat the
entire area just fine. (We were both happy that there is no sign of cancer in
the area he treated before!)

The only problem with this process is that it gets progressively harder and
harder. When I did this previously, I was teaching through the whole thing, and
toward the end, I had to stop near the end because the pain level got to high.
We will be talking about what to expect next week, but I suspect I already know
what will happen. My only real concern is that I do not want to lose my new
ability to open my mouth wide enough to actually eat. Before surgery, the
muscles that let my mouth open locked up at less than about half an inch. You
really cannot eat very well with that small an opening!. Now, I have about a full inch
and may be able to work that open more with exercise. That small amount makes a
world of difference!

Keep on praying
***************

Once again, Cheryl and I want to thank everyone who has read this blog, or been
in touch with us by phone or by email. Your prayers and kind words of support
are really making this ordeal much more bearable. We will never be able to
thank you enough!
