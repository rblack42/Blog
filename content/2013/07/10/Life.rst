Every once in a while, you get head-slapped (ala Gibbs) by something that
reminds you to pay attention to what is important in your life.

Yesterday, an air conditioner repairman stopped by Cheryl's office to work on a
system up in their attic. He climbed up a ladder into the area where he needed
to work, and everyone forgot about him. At least they did until the end of the
day when someone noticed that his truck was still there and no one had seen
him.

It turned out he died in the attic, why is still a puzzle. One of the staff
climbed up and found him not moving and called 911. When the EMT folks arrived,
he was gone and they could do nothing except remove him from the crawlspace.
The staff at Cheryl's office was notified, and the staff at the man's company
was also notified.

It is far too easy to get complacent abut your day to day life, and put things
off. I am sure this repairman had no idea yesterday would be his last day. It
could be the last day for any of us. What would you miss if that happened. What
plans, dreams, goals would you miss if you put things off for "just another day
or so"? 

I can study for that test tomorrow.

No need to clean the house today.

I will say I love you to someone special in the morning.

Make sure those things actually happen.

And say a prayer for the repairman, he was only 48
