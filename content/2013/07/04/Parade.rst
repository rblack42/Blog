Happy Birthday, America!

We have a day off from Radiation today! Cheryl had to go do an interview for a
potential employee this morning, so my sister and I went to the neighborhood
parade!

Last year, I rode in this parade in an Army truck. This time, we sat on the
side of the road and watched. It was short, but much more fun than one of the
big parades. Everyone got involved!

We had the new fire trucks, which the nearby town bought to fill up their two
new fire stations!

Not to mention the escaped fire hydrant!

My favorite was a "Thud" driver's F-107 (Thunderbolt to those in the know). He
flew one in Viet Nam, and this is his way of having fun on the Fourth!
