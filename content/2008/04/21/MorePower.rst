We Need More Power

This weekend was not so hot, as my mouth started hurting pretty much full
time. After my treatment today, I discussed this with my doctor (actually,
doctor #6) and his comment was "Captain, we need more power here", well not
actually, but he did agree I needed something stronger in the pain area. So I
am on the patch now - and I have absolutely no interest in smoking now. Wait,
this patch is actually a three day timed release pain drug which will help a
lot since Cheryl has been telling folks that I hover near the clock waiting
for time to take another dose of pain medicine - All too true!

I also hit the wall as far as teaching goes. Between the chemo and radiation
pain, I cannot talk for a full hour now (Alright, quiet in the peanut gallery!
I know that has not happened in 60 something years!) I feel like I am letting
my students down, though, but we are working out how to get through the rest
of the semester which is only about three weeks. My boss has been great
through all of this - helping me keep at it as I can and letting me have the
time off when needed. Teaching has been a big help in keeping my head screwed
on straight! I will probably be back after we end the treatments, but we will
need to wait and see.
