Break out the party duds and let's go get er done! Dr. Dziuk's staff does
throw a party on the last day of treatment and they give out a plaque. These
ladies (and a few gentlemen) have been very outgoing and helpful throughout
all of this. I will miss seeing then every day. They will miss me, no more "Oh
no, here comes trouble" when I walk in.

Cheryl, Karen and I made up some cards for all of them as farewell gifts, last
night, and these were a big hit! Dr Dziuk even got misty-eyed at the card!

The plaque was from one of his heroes, John Wayne:

    "Courage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway"

My cards said:

    To an Unsung Hero,

    You have made my journey through a dark time full of fun and laughter - at
    least as much as we both could muster given the situation. I hope I kept
    you on your toes as well

    My wife and I thank you deeply for all your care

Which sums up my feelings about this fine team nicely.

We had confetti:

We celebrated by stopping in Best Buy and looking for ways to spend all the
money we probably do not have. Maybe we will do a movie later. Me? I need to
find something to fill those lost hours on MoPac!

And with all that behind me we move into the healing phase, followed by the
testing to make sure we got everything we needed to! Time will tell, but life
goes on!

Thanks again to all of you on my care team, you have made the journey
possible, alone I do not like to think how I would have faired.
