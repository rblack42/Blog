After waiting for school to end and my surgeon's schedule to get clear, Dr.
Peter Scholl went in and removed all signs of the cancer in my mouth. By the
time he was done, I lost four teeth and have a hole in the roof of my mouth
(that actually goes through to my nose - yuck) that I need to live with. I
asked why we could not just insert some expandable foam to plug the hole, but
he laughed and said they were not that smart yet!

Oh well, guess I will live with it. (I just need to figure out what Diet Coke
feels like in my nose - HA!)

After I heal up, the real fun begins - radiation and chemo. Stay tuned!
