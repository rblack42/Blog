Who am I
********

I am a Professor of Computer Science at `Austin Community College
<http://www.austincc.edu/rblack>`_, in Austin Texas. I am also a retired Officer
in the United States Air Force, something I am pretty proud to be able to say!
I grew up in Falls Church, Virginia, graduated from Virginia Tech with degrees
in Aerospace Engineering, and from Texas State University with another degree
in Computer Science. This blog is my attempt to inspire my students, and to
tell the tale of my battle with cancer. At the end of the day, it is just
stories from my life.

So far, this Blog has been read by many folks keeping tabs on me, and others
seeking help fighting their own battle with cancer, or helping someone who is
doing so. This is my gift to all of you. Enjoy the stories, and I hope they
help you in some way to have a better life. I have had a blast in my life, even
considering this current battle I am fighting.
