..  _Guido: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_(slang)

For years, I have been doing a dis-service to those folks named "Guido". When I grew up, the Mafia was where all the bad guys hung out, and it seemed that the big, muscled, gun-toting, bad guys were all named "Giudo". So when I saw a relatively famous rule all computer programmers should follow::

    Write your code like the guy who has to maintain it is a serial killer who knows where you live"

I decided to name him (her?) "Guido"!

Sorry to all the Guidos in the world!

I tell my programming students this, and an often used line in my classes is:

     "Don't tick off Guido!"

Yesterday, I got an email from a former student, telling me how much he enjoyed my Computer Architecture class, and letting me know how he was doing in graduate school now. His closing line was way cool:

    I have not pissed off Guido yet!
