Do you remember what things you thought about when you were six. Some of those
things were crazy, but fun.

Inventing things
****************

Kids always want things they do not have. They even want things that do not
exist. That does not stop them from wanting those things anyway!

"Hey, Tommy, let's invent something."

"Like what?"

"I don't now, how about something that can dissolve anything, that would be
cool."

"Maybe, but what are we going to put it in?"

"Hmmm, I did not think about that. If we invent this stuff, we are going to
have a problem!"

"We sure will. That stuff will sink to the ground, and disolve its way to the
center of the Earth."

"Yep. And then it will start eating the entire Earth. Not cool!

Hey Tommy, let's not invent that stuff, OK?"

That falls into the same category as the irresistible force meeting the
unmovable object, something else we thought about when "Superman" hit the
planet!

Solving the Energy Crisis
*************************

In another session, Tommy and I were thinking about nuclear reactors, which
were new enough they were in the news all the time. The USS Nautilus was not
yet swimming around, but folks were talking about nuclear power.

"Hey Tommy, wouldn't it be neat to build a nuclear power station and put it in a
lunch box?"

"That sounds cool, we could use it to power our house, then plug it into our
car and power that. Shoot, we could take it anywhere."

"Hmmm, but what would happen if it acted up. What do they call that, 'going
critical' or something like that?"

"Yep, that is what they say. If it goes out of control it could blow up and
wipe out all of our town. That would be messy!"

"Right. I know, lets invent a rubber balloon that can only stretch so far, and
no matter what, it cannot expand further."

"What do we do with that?"

"Easy, we put the lunch box in the balloon. Then if it blows up it will only
wipe out you and a small space around you."

"I would rather it blew up you, not me".

"Yeah, yeah! Actually, that would work, and sometimes we would lose a few folks.
There are too many folks around anyway!"

Hmmm, those kids must have been living in Austin.

Art Linkletter
**************

Art used to host a TV show where he interviewed kids around this age. Some of
what they said and thought was hilarious. Shoot, their brains had not congealed
yet, they were just learning how the world works. Even better, they did not
know their idea were crazy. Only us older folks know that. 

Know what, sometimes the ideas kids come up with might work, if only we can
overcome just "knowing" that they are silly. The coolest inventions came out of
someone's mind, leaving the rest of us wondering why we did not think of that!

Where is my lunch box.
