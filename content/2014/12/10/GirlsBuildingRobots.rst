I use robotics as a "hook" to get my students interested in my "Computer
Architecture and Machine Language" course at |ACC|. It appears to be a popular
way to keep things interesting enough to attract todays' kids.

Here is one of my favorite robots, the Mars Rover:

Wait! That isn't the Mars Rover, this is:

It is still sitting there on Mars! That first one was built by two girls:
Camille and Genevive Beatty (14 and 12 respectively), with a
bit of help from dad, Robert Beatty!

Get your Kids Involved
**********************

So, your kids cannot get unhooked from Facebook? Have them take a look at this
link:

    * `Beatty Robotics <http://beatty-robotics.com/>`_

This site was put up by a dad helping his daughters get involved in Science and
Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). The girls do most of the machining and
wiring, dad helps with the programming. Way cool!

Here is the team that built this thing, which now resides in the `New York Hall
of Science <http://nymetroparents.com/listing/New-York-Hall-of-Science>`_!

Browse around their website! This is not the only project these kids have put
together, there is a lot of cool stuff there!
