Since I am sitting at home healing from the train wreck I went through, I decided to spif up my blog and get all the old articles back online. So, today you can see the result.

History
*******

I went back all the way to 2005 when I first put up a blog and worked all the posts into the current blog. This covers my first battle with cancer, which started in 2007. I always wanted this blog to cover everything I went through so that folks suffering the same kind of issues could see how another soul fought the battle. Hopefully this will help.

New features
************

I found another theme for the blog that has features you might like. 

The home page now shows the titles of the ten most recent posts, click on any title to get to that post.


At the top of the home page is a menu that includes "categories" and "tags". These are things I use to classify posts based on content, and If you are interested in reading other posts on those topics, this will help you find them. As far as I know now, this all works fine.

At the bottom of each post are links to the previous and next post in chronological order. For those who just want to browse the posts, these will work through everything on the site.

Back to resting
***************

This all took a fair amount of effort to clean up. I am still learning the details of the blog system I am using, so things may still need tweeking a bit. But it seems usable for now, so I am going to go back to resting and healing.

Hope you enjoy this new blog setup.
