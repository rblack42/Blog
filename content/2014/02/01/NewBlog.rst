Those of you who have been following my adventures for the last few years might
have noticed a break in the action the last few weeks. I had a PET scan a
while back and tried to post an article about that only to find that my blog
system broke down. The latest article went up fine, but everything else went
missing. Attempts to find the missing articles showed them on the website, but
not visible to mere mortals. Only the chosen few were able to make them appear. 

To say I was unhappy is an understatement.

Turns out I fell prey to competing versions of components of my software. When
you use "open source" tools written by nice folks who get no money for their
work, you depend on their efforts to fix things when they go wrong. Sometimes
they fix things, and sometimes they do not. This time, they did not.

So, I was stuck.

And I was not in the mood to worry about it while I waited for the results of
my PET scan.

I am still not in the right nood, but I needed to get my blog fixed, so I have
started working on a fix, and here is the start of that fix.

I have moved the system to a new engine, and will move over the old material
as I get time. This post is the first of the new material I will be putting up.
I will continue posting new material using this system, and as I get time, will
post the old material in reverse order so you can review what came before. It
should not take too long to get everything back up once I get into the swing of
things.

Sorry for the mixup, not all my fault.

Roie
