:Title: Off We Go

I got a call yesterday in the middle of a class, and it sounded like I
won the lottery! I have officially been accepted into the M. D. Anderson
Research program, which means my cancer is sufficiently interesting enough that
they want me over there to look at me in person. So Cheryl and I will head over
to Houston after my class tomorrow afternoon and check into the hotel attached
to their facility near downtown, and get ready to check in to the cancer center
at noon on Thursday. 

After a round of paperwork, I am to see my first doctor in the afternoon, and
then they plan of starting a round of tests early on Friday, that will continue
into the following week. Yikes. I am supposed to be teaching in Austin now. 

I am not sure for now how we are going to pull all of this off. I called my
boss to warn her that I might not be available at least for Monday classes, and
perhaps not for classes next Thursday, since they seem to have a PET scan
scheduled then in Houston. I may be on the road between here and there a bunch
for a while (about four hours one way).

Oh well, that is what it takes to get to the best chance I have If I must, I
must.

If all else fails, I will take sick leave and get someone to cover my classes,
or figure out how to turn my classroom courses into distance classes. I am
betting I can do that, if I can talk my boss into letting that happen.

We will see,

In the meantime, I am getting ready for the first road trip tomorrow!

Keep your fingers crossed that the good doctors there have some interesting
tricks up their sleeves!
