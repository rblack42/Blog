This is a place-holder while I get my pictures from my 50th High School Reunion
under control. I took a bunch, and I am sifting through all of them,
remembering names, or trying to remember them. 

Cheryl and I had a ball in Falls Church, exploring my old haunts, and visiting
with folks I have not seen in 50 years. We told lies - er - stories about what
we had done with our lives, and thought back to when we had all of that before
us. There were around 67 of my classmates there.

Thanks to Judy Ingalls Hughes for putting all of this together, with help from
a lot of folks from the class. I helped a bit, but was too busy fighting off
Cancer.

As I work on this note, here is Cheryl and I in the first reasonable photo I
have been in since I had my last battle!

We had a blast, and thanks to all of you who told me how much you have enjoyed
my stories, and who have prayed for me as I went through my adventures!

I will add to this later, after I complete my review of the pictures we took.
