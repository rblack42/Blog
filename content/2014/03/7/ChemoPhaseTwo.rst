Here we are at the end of week three after starting the M. D. Anderson treatment
plan, and it is tough, but looks like things are at least working on some
level. That much is good news. The chemo is definitely having an effect that I
can feel that is positive as far as the tumor is concerned.

My vision is definitely better, the pressure in my face near my left eye is
much reduced, the pain in that area is much less, so much so that we have
backed off of the pain medicine I have been on since the original surgery. We
are very grateful for all of that.

Side effect bad mojo!
*********************

Chemo does have it's bad side, everyone knows that. Apparently I am tougher
that many, and it took longer for the chemo to do its evil on me that for some,
but it has slowly settled in and I am feeling its full force.

Slowly, it sapped all of my energy away. I was doing fine the first week, then
wanted to rest a lot the second week, and even more the third. My appetite
slowly vanished, which we finally figured out was due to increasing nausea
issues. The 8 hour nausea medicine I have been on was not really up to the
problems, do this last week, I called in and got something stronger, especially
when I discovered that I had lost six pounds in one week. My appetite came back
and I am eating much better now.

Mouth sores
***********

Last week, my mouth got pretty raw, enough so that I went to the doctor to see
what we could do. They prescribes two different mouth washes, one of which
sparked my mouth to death, and the other iust numbed it to sleep. Together,
they did a nice job, and mu mouth is much better. I still prefer pretty bland
food, but I am able to eat a more varied selection of foods, as long as they
are fairly soft and not very spicy.

Overall, I am doing much better.
