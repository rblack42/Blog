:Title: More White Blood Cells, Please

Today, I need more white blood cells, So off we go to the Texas Oncology
Clinic for another $8000 shot. Oh, yeah, I forgot, after all the insurance
wrangling, it falls down to $650 or so. Cheryl is taking me there then coming
home to rest, as she is not feeling well. I hope it is just stress from
yesterday. 

Cheryl picked up my prescriptions this morning. The new one is an antibiotic to
help with the rash I have on my back. Apparently it is bad enough that Dr Keis
want to hit it harder. I cannot see it so I took a better look this morning. It
is much worse than on my chest and face. Good thing, or my students would be
running from the room!

Maybe this will help before things get worse after Spring Break!
