I finally got tired of WordPress. Not because it is a bad product, but because
I write a lot of material in reStructuredText, and I do not want to use any
other system. Add to that that I want my blog entries to work the same way as
my course notes, and I needed to build a new system.

Since I use Python Sphinx to process my course notes, I did a bit of Googling
and came up with the Tinkerer project. Now, I can use the same system I use to
process my notes to write my blog entries, and as a bonus, get to add comments
to my material using Disqus. More fun with Python!
